--- MEETING START ---

Lisa: Alright everyone, thanks for joining. We're here to define requirements for our new customer support platform. Our current system is... well, let's just say it's not meeting our needs anymore. Sarah, can you start with the pain points?

Sarah: Absolutely. Our biggest issue is that we have no unified view of customers. Support tickets are in one system, chat conversations in another, emails scattered across different inboxes. When a customer contacts us, agents spend 5-10 minutes just trying to understand their history. It's embarrassing.

Emma: And from an operational standpoint, we have no visibility into team performance. I can't tell you which agents are struggling, what types of issues take longest to resolve, or even basic metrics like first response time across all channels.

Marcus: The technical debt is significant too. We're running three different support tools that don't talk to each other, plus some homegrown scripts. Integration nightmares everywhere.

Lisa: Okay, so what would the ideal system look like? Let's think big picture first.

Sarah: I want a single interface where agents can see everything about a customer - their account details, purchase history, all previous interactions across email, chat, phone, social media. Everything in one timeline.

Emma: Yes! And I need real-time dashboards showing queue depths, response times, agent availability. Plus automated routing so tickets go to the right person based on expertise, language, current workload.

David: From a development perspective, we need something that can scale. We're planning to grow from 15 support agents to 50+ over the next two years. The system needs to handle that growth without performance degradation.

Marcus: And we need proper APIs. Our CRM needs to sync customer data, our billing system needs to create automatic tickets for payment issues, our product team wants to feed bug reports directly from the app.

Lisa: What about self-service? Are customers asking for that?

Sarah: Constantly. They want to check order status, update account info, find answers to common questions without contacting us. But our current knowledge base is a mess - articles are outdated, search doesn't work, no way to track what people are actually looking for.

Emma: A good self-service portal could probably reduce our ticket volume by 30-40%. But it needs to be smart - if someone can't find what they need, it should seamlessly transition them to a human agent with context about what they were trying to do.

David: We should think about AI integration too. Not to replace agents, but to help them. Auto-categorizing tickets, suggesting responses based on similar past issues, even auto-resolving simple requests like password resets.

Marcus: Agreed. But let's be realistic about AI complexity for v1. We can build hooks for future AI integration without overcomplicating the initial build.

Lisa: Good point. Let's talk about specific features. What are the must-haves versus nice-to-haves?

Sarah: Must-haves: unified customer timeline, omnichannel support - email, chat, phone integration, ticket management with proper categorization and priority levels.

Emma: Add to that: team management with role-based permissions, SLA tracking, automated escalation rules, and basic reporting. Oh, and mobile access - agents need to respond from their phones sometimes.

David: Multi-language support is crucial. We have customers in 12 countries now. And we need to handle attachments properly - screenshots, documents, video files.

Marcus: Security can't be an afterthought. GDPR compliance, data encryption, audit logs, SSO integration with our existing systems.

Lisa: What about the customer-facing side?

Sarah: Self-service portal with knowledge base, FAQ search, ability to submit tickets and track status. Account management features so they can update their info without contacting us.

Emma: Community forums would be amazing too. Let customers help each other, with our agents moderating and jumping in when needed.

David: We should have a mobile app eventually, but maybe not for v1. The web portal needs to be fully responsive though.

Lisa: Let's talk workflow. Emma, walk me through what a typical support interaction should look like in the new system.

Emma: Customer submits a ticket or starts a chat. System automatically creates a unified case, pulls in their full history, categorizes the issue based on keywords or previous similar cases.

The case gets routed to the right agent based on expertise, language, current workload. Agent opens the case and immediately sees customer's account details, recent orders, previous interactions, any open cases.

Agent can respond via the same channel customer used, or switch channels if needed - like escalating a chat to a phone call. All interactions get logged to the same case timeline.

If it's a complex issue, agent can easily collaborate with colleagues - internal notes, case assignments, escalation to specialists or managers.

Sarah: And the customer sees a consistent experience regardless of channel. They start with chat, continue via email, call later - agents have full context every time.

David: What about automation rules? Like auto-assigning certain types of issues or escalating high-value customers?

Emma: Absolutely. We need flexible rule engines. If a ticket mentions "billing," route to billing team. If customer spent more than $50k this year, mark as high priority. If no response in 4 hours, escalate to manager.

Marcus: That sounds like we need a proper workflow engine, not just simple if-then rules.

Lisa: What kind of reporting do we need?

Emma: Everything! Agent performance metrics - response times, resolution rates, customer satisfaction scores. Team metrics - volume trends, backlog size, seasonal patterns. Issue analytics - what problems are most common, where customers get stuck in our product.

Sarah: Customer-centric reporting too. Which customers contact us most often, what their common issues are, satisfaction trends over time.

David: We need to track self-service usage too. What articles people read, where they drop off, what searches return no results.

Lisa: Integration requirements?

Marcus: Our CRM is Salesforce - needs bi-directional sync. Billing system is custom built - needs to create tickets automatically for payment failures. Our product sends crash reports that should create bug tickets.

We're also planning to integrate with our live chat widget, social media monitoring tools, and eventually our mobile app.

David: Don't forget Slack integration. Agents want notifications there, and sometimes we need to discuss complex cases in dedicated channels.

Lisa: What about data migration? We have years of support history.

Emma: We need to migrate at least 2 years of ticket history. Older stuff can be archived but should still be searchable. Customer account data obviously needs to come over completely.

Marcus: That's going to be tricky given our current data mess. We'll need a solid data cleanup and migration strategy.

Lisa: Timeline expectations?

Sarah: We're hemorrhaging customers due to poor support experience. I'd love to see something in production within 6 months, but I know that's aggressive.

Marcus: For a system this complex? We're looking at 9-12 months minimum. But we could do a phased rollout - start with core ticketing, add chat integration, then self-service portal.

David: Phases make sense. Get the foundation solid first, then layer on the advanced features.

Lisa: Budget considerations?

Marcus: We're looking at significant infrastructure costs - database servers, application servers, CDN for file attachments. Plus licensing for any third-party components.

We'll need 3-4 developers dedicated to this for the full timeline, plus DevOps support, QA resources.

Emma: Don't forget training time. We'll need to train all existing agents on the new system, create new documentation, update our processes.

Lisa: What could go wrong? Let's think about risks.

Marcus: Data migration is the biggest technical risk. If we lose customer history or corrupt data during the switch, that's a disaster.

Sarah: User adoption risk. If the new system is harder to use than our current tools, agents will resist the change.

Emma: Integration complexity. If we can't get clean data from Salesforce or our billing system breaks, we're in trouble.

David: Scalability. If we build something that works for 15 agents but falls apart at 50 agents, we'll have to rebuild in two years.

Lisa: What about mobile usage patterns?

Sarah: About 40% of our customers primarily use mobile devices. The self-service portal absolutely needs to work well on phones and tablets.

Emma: For agents, it's more about urgent notifications and quick responses when they're out of office. Not full case management on mobile.

David: We should design mobile-first for the customer portal, desktop-first for the agent interface.

Lisa: Any compliance requirements we haven't discussed?

Marcus: GDPR is obvious, but we also need to think about data retention policies, right to deletion, data portability.

Some of our enterprise customers have specific security requirements - SOC 2 compliance, data residency requirements.

Sarah: We need to be very careful with PII handling, especially in chat logs and recorded calls.

Lisa: What about disaster recovery?

Marcus: We need proper backup strategies, ability to failover to different data centers, maybe even different cloud providers if we're going cloud-native.

Emma: Business continuity planning too. If the system goes down, what's our fallback? We can't just stop providing support.

Lisa: Okay, let's talk about success metrics. How do we know this project is successful?

Sarah: Customer satisfaction scores up by 20%, first response time under 2 hours for all channels, customer effort score improvements.

Emma: Agent productivity up 30%, case resolution time down 25%, support ticket volume per customer down 15% due to better self-service.

David: System uptime 99.5%+, page load times under 2 seconds, mobile responsiveness score above 90.

Marcus: Clean integrations with zero data loss, API response times under 500ms, successful data migration with less than 0.1% error rate.

Lisa: Any other features we haven't covered?

Sarah: Video support would be huge. Sometimes screen sharing is the fastest way to help a customer.

Emma: Advanced search across all historical cases. Sometimes agents need to find similar issues from months ago.

David: Bulk operations for agents. Sometimes they need to update 50 tickets at once or merge duplicate cases.

Marcus: Comprehensive audit logging. We need to track every action for compliance and debugging.

Lisa: What about future growth? What should we design for but not build initially?

Sarah: International expansion. We might need support for different time zones, currencies, languages beyond our current 3.

Emma: Advanced AI features like sentiment analysis, automatic response suggestions, predictive routing.

David: Voice integration - customers calling in, voice-to-text transcription, integration with our phone system.

Marcus: Advanced analytics and machine learning for predicting customer issues, identifying at-risk accounts.

Lisa: Alright, I think we have enough to start with. Let me summarize what I'm hearing:

Core platform with unified customer view, omnichannel support, automated routing, comprehensive reporting. Self-service portal with knowledge base and account management. Mobile-responsive design, strong security, scalable architecture.

Phase 1: Core ticketing system, basic integrations
Phase 2: Chat integration, self-service portal
Phase 3: Advanced automation, AI features
Phase 4: Mobile apps, advanced analytics

Timeline: 9-12 months for full system, with quarterly releases.

Any final thoughts or concerns?

Emma: We need to involve the support team in testing from day one. Not just at the end - throughout the development process.

Sarah: Change management is crucial. This will completely transform how we work with customers.

Marcus: We should start with a solid technical architecture. If we get the foundation wrong, everything else becomes harder.

David: Documentation and training materials need to be part of the development timeline, not an afterthought.

Lisa: Perfect. Next steps: I'll work with Marcus on technical architecture, Sarah will define detailed user stories, Emma will create current-state process documentation. We'll reconvene next week to review the formal requirements document.

Thanks everyone!
