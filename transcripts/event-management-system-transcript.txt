Duration: 1 hour 15 minutes
Participants: Maria Santos (Community Manager), Brian Kim (Event Coordinator), Lisa Thompson (Marketing), Dave Chen (Developer)

--- MEETING START ---

Maria: Thanks for joining everyone. We need to build a simple system to manage our community events. Right now everything is in spreadsheets and it's getting chaotic as we grow.

Brian: Last month we had three events running simultaneously and I lost track of who was attending what. We oversold two events and undersold another.

Lisa: From a marketing perspective, I can't track which promotional channels are working. Are people finding our events through social media, email, or word of mouth?

Dave: And technically, we're using Google Forms for registration, Eventbrite for some events, manual email lists for others. It's a mess to manage.

Maria: So what would make our lives easier? Let's start with the basics.

Brian: A central place to create and manage all our events. Basic info like title, date, time, location, capacity, description.

Lisa: Registration management. People should be able to sign up online, get confirmation emails, receive reminders.

Dave: Attendee tracking. Who's registered, who actually showed up, waitlist management when events are full.

Maria: What about different types of events? We do workshops, networking mixers, speaker sessions, volunteer activities.

Brian: Good point. Different event types might need different registration information. Workshop might need skill level, networking event might need job title.

Lisa: Some events are free, others have fees. Need to handle both registration types.

Dave: And some events are members-only, others are open to public. Need access controls.

Maria: Let's talk about the user experience. What should it look like for attendees?

Lisa: Simple event listing page showing upcoming events with key details - date, time, location, brief description.

Brian: Event detail pages with full descriptions, speaker bios if applicable, agenda or schedule.

Dave: Easy registration process. Click register, fill out basic info, get confirmation. No complicated account creation required.

Maria: What information do we need from attendees?

Brian: Name, email, phone number for reminders. Maybe dietary restrictions for catered events.

Lisa: How they heard about the event for marketing tracking. Company or organization they're with for networking events.

Dave: Emergency contact info for outdoor events or activities with higher risk.

Maria: Any special accommodations they need for accessibility.

Brian: For workshops, maybe their experience level or what they hope to learn.

Maria: What about the organizer side? What features do we need?

Brian: Event creation wizard. Template-based setup for different event types to make it faster.

Lisa: Attendee management dashboard. See who's registered, send messages to specific groups, manage waitlists.

Dave: Simple check-in system. Maybe QR codes on confirmation emails that we can scan at the door.

Maria: Reporting and analytics. How many people registered, showed up, no-shows by event type.

Brian: Calendar integration so events automatically appear in our work calendars.

Lisa: Email communication tools. Send event reminders, updates, follow-up surveys.

Maria: What about promotion and marketing features?

Lisa: Social media integration. Auto-post new events to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn.

Brian: Email newsletter integration. Automatically include upcoming events in our monthly newsletter.

Dave: Simple landing pages for each event that we can link to from various promotional channels.

Lisa: Registration tracking by source. Which marketing channels drive the most registrations.

Maria: Location and venue management?

Brian: Venue database with capacity limits, address, parking info, accessibility details.

Dave: Integration with maps for directions. Maybe even parking availability if we can get that data.

Maria: Room setup requirements for different event types. Classroom style, networking setup, presentation format.

Brian: Equipment needs tracking. Do we need projectors, microphones, catering, tables?

Maria: What about recurring events?

Brian: Monthly book club, weekly yoga classes, quarterly board meetings. Should be easy to create recurring series.

Lisa: Automatic registration opening. Like registration opens 30 days before each monthly event.

Dave: Series management. People can register for single events or the whole series.

Maria: What could go wrong? What problems should we anticipate?

Brian: Overbooking events due to manual errors or system glitches. We need clear capacity management.

Lisa: Spam registrations or people registering for free events they don't plan to attend.

Dave: System downtime during high-registration periods, like when we announce popular speakers.

Maria: Data privacy concerns. We're collecting personal information and need to handle it properly.

Brian: No-show management. People register but don't attend, making it seem full when seats are available.

Maria: What integrations do we need?

Dave: Email system integration for automated confirmations and reminders.

Lisa: Google Calendar integration for easy event scheduling and calendar sharing.

Brian: Payment processing for paid events. Nothing too complex, just basic credit card handling.

Maria: CRM integration to track community member engagement across events.

Dave: Survey tools for post-event feedback collection.

Maria: What about mobile access?

Lisa: Mobile-responsive registration. Many people will sign up from their phones.

Brian: Mobile check-in capability. Tablet or phone app for scanning QR codes at events.

Dave: Mobile-friendly event listings and details. People browse events on mobile frequently.

Maria: Success metrics?

Brian: Registration completion rate up, no-show rate down, faster event setup process.

Lisa: Increased event attendance through better promotion and easier registration.

Dave: Reduced manual work - fewer spreadsheets, fewer email management tasks.

Maria: Better attendee satisfaction through smoother registration and communication.

Brian: More events per month as the system makes management easier.

Maria: What features can wait for later phases?

Dave: Advanced analytics, complex reporting dashboards. Basic metrics are fine initially.

Lisa: Social media auto-posting, advanced marketing automation. Manual posting is okay for now.

Brian: Complex event series management. Simple recurring events are sufficient.

Maria: Integration with accounting systems for paid event revenue tracking.

Dave: Mobile apps. Mobile-responsive web is enough for version 1.

Maria: What's a realistic timeline?

Dave: This is pretty straightforward. Basic event management, registration, attendee tracking - maybe 2-3 months development.

Brian: We have the summer event season coming up in 4 months. Would be great to have this ready by then.

Lisa: Need time for testing and user training before we go live with real events.

Maria: Phased approach?

Dave: Phase 1: Event creation, basic registration, attendee management. 6-8 weeks.

Brian: Phase 2: Check-in system, email communications, basic reporting. Another 4 weeks.

Lisa: Phase 3: Marketing integrations, advanced features, payment processing. Final 4-6 weeks.

Maria: We could start using Phase 1 for simple events while building the rest.

Brian: What about data migration from our current systems?

Dave: We have maybe 500 past attendees in various spreadsheets. Should be straightforward to import.

Lisa: Historical event data for analytics. Would be nice but not critical for launch.

Maria: Future event registrations in progress. Need to be careful not to disrupt anything already scheduled.

Maria: Budget considerations?

Dave: Mainly development time and hosting costs. Pretty minimal for a system this size.

Brian: Potential costs for email service integration, payment processing fees.

Lisa: Maybe some design work to make it look professional and match our branding.

Maria: Any other features to consider?

Brian: Volunteer coordination for events that need help. Sign up volunteers for different roles.

Lisa: Post-event photo sharing. Simple gallery where attendees can share pictures.

Dave: Basic event feedback collection. Star ratings and comments after events.

Maria: Waiting list notifications. Auto-notify people if spots open up due to cancellations.

Brian: Event categories or tags for better organization and filtering.

Maria: What about accessibility requirements?

Lisa: Screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, high contrast options.

Brian: Large text options, audio descriptions for visual content.

Dave: Simple, clear language throughout. No jargon or complex instructions.

Maria: Multiple language support eventually, but English-only for v1.

Brian: Let me make sure I understand the core workflow:

1. Create event with basic details and capacity
2. Open registration with custom form fields
3. Attendees register online and get confirmations
4. Send reminders and updates as needed
5. Check people in at the event
6. Collect feedback and track attendance
7. Generate reports on event success

Does that cover it?

Maria: That's perfect. Simple but comprehensive.

Lisa: The key is making each step as easy as possible. Both for us organizing and for people attending.

Dave: Agreed. Better to have fewer features that work really well than lots of features that are confusing.

Maria: Alright, next steps. Dave, can you create a technical specification document? Brian, can you document our current event management process and pain points? Lisa, can you define the marketing and communication requirements?

Let's reconvene next week to review the detailed requirements and start development planning.

Thanks everyone!
