[00:00] Facilitator: Thanks for joining us today, Jessica. Can you tell me about how you currently track your personal expenses?

[00:18] Jessica: Honestly, it's all over the place. I use my banking app to see what I spent, but I can never remember what things were for. I have a spreadsheet that I update maybe once a month when I'm feeling motivated, but it's always behind. I try to budget but I never really know if I'm sticking to it until it's too late.

[00:35] Facilitator: That sounds like a common challenge. Let's see if this app can help. I'm sharing the prototype with you now. What do you see on the home screen?

[00:52] Jessica: Oh, this is nice! I can see my spending for this month - $2,847 out of a $3,200 budget. There's a visual progress bar that's mostly filled but still green. Below that I see recent transactions - looks like it's pulling from my bank account automatically. There's a "Add Expense" button and tabs for Home, Budget, Insights, and Goals.

[01:15] Facilitator: You mentioned it looks like it's pulling from your bank account. How do you feel about that?

[01:22] Jessica: Actually, that's amazing! I can see transactions from yesterday that I already forgot about - a $4.50 coffee and $12 lunch. It's categorized them automatically as "Food & Drink." That would save me so much time compared to my spreadsheet.

[01:38] Facilitator: Let's say you want to add an expense that might not show up automatically, like a cash purchase. How would you do that?

[01:45] Jessica: I'd tap "Add Expense"... *taps*

Perfect! It's asking me for the amount, category, and description. Let me add that $20 I spent on street food yesterday - I'll put $20, select "Food & Drink" and describe it as "Street tacos lunch."

Oh interesting, it's asking me to take a photo of the receipt or add notes. I don't have the receipt but I'll add a note about where it was.

[02:12] Facilitator: How does this manual entry process feel compared to your spreadsheet?

[02:17] Jessica: So much faster! In my spreadsheet I have to remember the date, figure out which category column to put it in, and do the math myself. This is just a few taps and it automatically updates my budget tracking.

[02:32] Facilitator: Let's explore the budgeting features. Can you find where you'd set up your monthly budget?

[02:38] Jessica: Let me try the Budget tab... *taps*

Wow, this is comprehensive! I can see all my categories with how much I've spent versus budgeted. "Groceries: $287 of $400" - I'm doing okay there. But "Entertainment: $156 of $100" - oops, I'm over budget already and it's only the 28th!

[02:58] Jessica: I love that it shows me which categories I'm overspending in. The red progress bars make it really obvious. And I can tap on any category to see all the transactions in it.

[03:15] Facilitator: How would you adjust your entertainment budget if you wanted to allow for more spending?

[03:21] Jessica: Let me tap on Entertainment... I see an "Edit Budget" option. *taps*

Nice! I can adjust the monthly amount - let me change it from $100 to $150. It's asking if I want to apply this change going forward or adjust this month too. I'll say going forward since I already spent more than planned.

[03:42] Facilitator: What about setting up a new budget category?

[03:46] Jessica: I see an "Add Category" button... Let me try adding "Pet Expenses" since I just got a dog. I can set the monthly budget to $80 and choose an icon - there's a cute paw print option.

[04:02] Facilitator: Let's look at the insights section. What kind of information do you see there?

[04:08] Jessica: The Insights tab is really cool! *taps*

I can see my spending trends over the last few months. It shows I spent way more in December - probably holiday shopping. There's a breakdown of my top spending categories and even my most expensive single purchases.

[04:26] Jessica: Oh this is interesting - it's showing me that I spend 23% more on weekends versus weekdays. And most of my food spending happens between 12-2pm and 6-8pm, which makes sense for lunch and dinner.

[04:42] Facilitator: Do these insights surprise you or confirm what you expected?

[04:47] Jessica: Both! I knew I spent more on weekends but 23% more is higher than I thought. The meal timing makes perfect sense. But I'm surprised that "Transportation" is my third-highest category - I didn't realize how much I spend on Ubers and parking.

[05:08] Facilitator: Let's check out the Goals section. What do you see there?

[05:14] Jessica: *taps Goals tab*

This looks like where I can set savings goals and track progress. I see some suggested goals like "Emergency Fund" and "Vacation Savings." Let me try setting up a vacation goal...

I'll call it "Europe Trip" with a target of $3,000 by December. It's asking how much I want to save monthly - if I say $300, it shows I'll reach my goal by November. That's helpful math I wouldn't have done myself!

[05:42] Facilitator: How would this goal tracking change your spending behavior?

[05:47] Jessica: Seeing it right on the home screen would definitely make me think twice about impulse purchases. If I can see I'm behind on my savings goal, I might skip that expensive dinner out. It makes the trade-offs more concrete.

[06:05] Facilitator: Let's say you want to see how you're doing compared to last month. How would you do that?

[06:11] Jessica: Let me go back to Insights... I see there's a time period selector at the top. I can choose "Last Month" or "3 Months" or custom dates.

*selects Last Month*

Interesting! Last month I spent $2,756 total versus $2,847 this month so far. But last month I spent way more on shopping - $345 versus $89 this month. I've been good about avoiding online shopping lately.

[06:38] Facilitator: What about tracking subscriptions? Do you see anything for that?

[06:43] Jessica: Good question... Let me look around. In the Budget section, I see there's a "Subscriptions" category. When I tap on it, it shows my Netflix, Spotify, and gym membership.

Oh cool! It's flagged that my gym membership might be a subscription since it's the same amount monthly from the same merchant. It's asking if I want to set up automatic categorization for future charges. That would catch subscriptions I forget about.

[07:12] Facilitator: How do you feel about the app's automatic categorization overall?

[07:17] Jessica: It's been surprisingly accurate! Maybe 90% of my transactions are categorized correctly. When it gets something wrong, I can just tap and fix it, and I assume it learns from that. Much better than having to categorize everything manually.

[07:35] Facilitator: What about security? How comfortable are you with connecting your bank account?

[07:41] Jessica: Initially I was nervous, but I noticed it says it uses bank-level encryption and read-only access. I already use similar apps like Mint, so I'm comfortable with it. The convenience is worth it - I'd never keep up with manual entry.

[07:58] Facilitator: Any features you wish you had or things you'd change?

[08:04] Jessica: I'd love to see bill reminders - like a notification that my credit card payment is due soon. Also, maybe photo receipts for cash purchases would be helpful for remembering what I bought.

[08:20] Jessica: Oh, and splitting expenses with friends! Like when we go out to dinner and I pay, but everyone owes me money back. That happens a lot and I always forget to collect.

[08:35] Facilitator: How would this app change your financial habits?

[08:40] Jessica: Completely! Having real-time visibility into my spending would make me so much more aware of where my money goes. The automatic tracking means I'd actually stick with it instead of abandoning it after a few weeks like my spreadsheet.

[08:58] Jessica: The goal tracking would motivate me to save more, and seeing those spending patterns would help me make better choices. Like maybe I don't need to spend $156 on entertainment every month!

[09:15] Facilitator: Would you recommend this to friends?

[09:19] Jessica: Absolutely! Anyone who struggles with budgeting or wants to understand their spending better would love this. It's so much easier than manual tracking, and the insights are actually useful, not just overwhelming data.

[09:35] Jessica: The only hesitation would be people who are really privacy-conscious about bank connections, but for most people, the convenience and insights would outweigh those concerns.
