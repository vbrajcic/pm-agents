   and a detailed implementation roadmap."
   ```

3. **Review & Iterate:**
   - Claude asks clarifying questions
   - You provide answers

   ```

5. **Get Feature List:**
   - Claude identifies all features
   - Provides priority levels (P0, P1, P2, P3)
   - Breaks each into development tasks
   - Save the feature list

**Week 3-N: Create Feature PRDs**

6. **For Each Feature, Use Feature PRD Writer:**
   ```

## Tips for Best Results

### General Tips:
1. **Start with Context** - Always provide background before asking for output
2. **Iterate** - Claude will ask clarifying questions - answer them!
3. **Review & Refine** - First draft is rarely perfect - ask for improvements
4. **Save Everything** - Keep PRDs in version control (git)
5. **Use Markdown** - All agents output markdown for easy formatting

### Project PRD Writer Tips:
- Include actual stakeholder quotes from meetings
- Mention specific dates and timelines
- Highlight any conflicts or disagreements
- Provide budget/resource constraints if known

### Feature PRD Writer Tips:
- Be specific about user types and roles
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Mention integrations with other features
- Flag anything you're uncertain about

### Feature Extractor Tips:
- Feed it complete, well-structured PRDs
- Request traceability to original requirements
- Ask for priority justifications
- Use output for roadmap and sprint planning

## Troubleshooting

### "Agent doesn't follow the process"
**Solution:** Make sure you pasted the ENTIRE agent file (including the YAML front matter at the top with `---`)

### "Output is too generic"
**Solution:** Provide more specific context. Include actual data, names, requirements, not just "create a PRD for an app"

### "Missing information in PRD"
**Solution:** That's intentional! Agents flag what's missing. Provide the missing info and regenerate.

### "PRD is too long/short"
**Solution:** Ask Claude to adjust:
- "Make this more concise, focus on essentials"
- "Expand this with more detail on [specific section]"

### "Need different format"
**Solution:** All agents output Markdown. You can ask Claude to convert to:
- "Convert this to a Google Docs outline"
- "Format this as a Confluence page"
- "Create a Jira epic with subtasks from this"
