## Background & Context

### Current State Analysis
Most people struggle with personal financial management, using fragmented approaches like banking apps (transaction history only), spreadsheets (manual and abandoned), or mental budgeting (inaccurate and stressful). Current solutions either lack automation (spreadsheets) or provide overwhelming data without actionable insights (banking apps).

### Stakeholder Landscape

**Primary Users:**
- **Young Professionals**: Need simple budgeting to establish financial habits and save for goals
- **Busy Families**: Require automated tracking to manage complex household finances efficiently
- **Goal-Oriented Savers**: Want progress tracking and insights to achieve specific financial milestones

**Key Stakeholders:**
- **Financial Institutions**: Provide transaction data through secure APIs and benefit from engaged customers
- **App Store Platforms**: Revenue through premium subscriptions and in-app purchases
- **Financial Advisors**: Potential integration partners for premium financial planning services
- **Privacy Advocates**: Require transparent data handling and security measures

### Strategic Rationale
Personal financial stress affects 76% of Americans, yet existing solutions are either too complex (traditional software) or too simplistic (basic banking apps). Mobile-first automation can eliminate friction while providing actionable insights that drive behavior change and improve financial outcomes.
