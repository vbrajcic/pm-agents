## Background & Context

### Current State Analysis
The organization currently handles employee onboarding through manual, paper-based processes with significant pain points:
- **Time Intensive**: IT spends 2-3 hours per new hire on manual account setup
- **Error Prone**: Forgotten steps and inconsistent processes lead to poor employee experience
- **Document Scattered**: Checklists and forms exist across multiple platforms and formats
- **Poor Visibility**: No centralized tracking of onboarding progress or completion status
- **Compliance Risk**: Manual document handling increases risk of missing required forms

### Stakeholder Landscape
**Primary Users:**
- **New Employees**: Need clear guidance, progress visibility, and mobile access to complete onboarding tasks
- **HR Staff**: Require automated workflow management, document processing, and compliance tracking
- **IT Administrators**: Need automated account provisioning and integration management
- **Hiring Managers**: Want visibility into team member progress and structured check-in scheduling

**Key Stakeholders:**
- **HR Department**: Compliance requirements, document retention policies, and process efficiency needs
- **IT Department**: Security standards, system integration capabilities, and infrastructure requirements
- **Operations Team**: Workflow optimization, notification management, and resource allocation coordination
- **Executive Leadership**: ROI measurement, employee satisfaction metrics, and operational efficiency goals

### Strategic Rationale
This project addresses critical operational inefficiencies while positioning the organization for scalable growth. The current manual processes are unsustainable with increasing hiring volume and create unnecessary friction for new employees during their critical first impression period. Automation will free up valuable HR and IT resources while ensuring consistent, compliant onboarding experiences.
