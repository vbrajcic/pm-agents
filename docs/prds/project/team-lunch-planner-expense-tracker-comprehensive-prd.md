# Team Lunch Planner & Expense Tracker — Comprehensive Project PRD
*Platform: Mobile/Web App | Type: Internal Tool/Team Coordination Platform*

## Executive Summary

### Project Vision
Create a unified platform that streamlines team lunch coordination and expense management, eliminating the chaos of ad-hoc planning and the awkwardness of bill splitting while providing transparency and insights for better team budget management.

### Strategic Objectives
- Reduce time spent on lunch coordination by 80% (from ~10 minutes to ~2 minutes per session)
- Eliminate bill splitting friction and forgotten reimbursements
- Provide transparent team spending insights for better budget planning
- Increase team lunch participation through seamless coordination

### Expected Outcomes
Teams save 30+ minutes per week on lunch coordination, achieve 100% expense reimbursement accuracy, and gain data-driven insights for team budget optimization while improving team culture through easier meal sharing.

### Project Scope

**In Scope:**
- Lunch planning and invitation system with preference-based restaurant recommendations
- Integrated expense tracking with receipt scanning and OCR
- Automated bill splitting with multiple payment options
- Team analytics and spending insights dashboard
- Calendar integration and availability checking
- Real-time notification and response tracking

**Out of Scope:**
- Full restaurant reservation system integration
- Comprehensive expense reporting for non-meal expenses
- Integration with corporate accounting systems (Phase 2)
- Advanced dietary restriction matching algorithms

## Background & Context

### Current State Analysis
Teams currently rely on fragmented communication (Slack messages like "lunch at 12?") leading to 10+ minute coordination cycles. Bill splitting involves awkward separate check requests or forgotten reimbursements, creating financial friction and team tension. No visibility into team spending patterns makes budget planning reactive rather than proactive.

### Stakeholder Landscape

**Primary Users:**
- **Team Members**: Need easy coordination, fair expense splitting, and spending transparency
- **Team Organizers**: Require efficient planning tools considering preferences, budgets, and availability
- **Finance-Conscious Users**: Want budget controls and spending visibility

**Key Stakeholders:**
- **Team Managers**: Need spending insights for budget planning and team culture building
- **Finance Teams**: Require accurate expense tracking and potential integration points
- **HR/People Operations**: Value team coordination tools that improve workplace culture

### Strategic Rationale
Team coordination inefficiencies create daily friction that compounds over time. The app addresses real pain points while providing valuable data for organizational budget planning. The network effect of team adoption creates strong user retention and viral growth within organizations.
