# Profico Inventory Management System — Comprehensive Project PRD
*Platform: Web Application | Type: Internal Tool*

## Executive Summary
### Project Vision
Build a comprehensive internal inventory management system that tracks all company equipment and software subscriptions, streamlines request and approval workflows, and provides financial visibility for accounting and budgeting purposes.

### Strategic Objectives
- Eliminate manual equipment tracking and reduce administrative overhead
- Provide complete visibility into company assets for accurate financial reporting
- Streamline equipment request and approval processes across all organizational levels
- Enable data-driven budgeting and equipment lifecycle management

### Expected Outcomes
- 90% reduction in time spent on equipment tracking and invoice collection
- Complete audit trail for all company assets for compliance and accounting
- Improved employee experience through self-service equipment requests
- Accurate budget forecasting based on equipment lifecycle data

### Project Scope
**In Scope:**
- Physical equipment management (laptops, displays, phones, tablets, accessories)
- Software subscription tracking and management
- Multi-tier request and approval workflows
- User role management and access control
- Financial integration for invoice and expense tracking
- Mobile-responsive interface with barcode/QR scanning capabilities
- Reporting and analytics for inventory and financial oversight

**Out of Scope:**
- Direct integration with accounting software (manual export initially)
- Automatic subscription renewal management
- Physical asset tagging generation (will use existing or manual solutions)
- Integration with external vendor APIs for automatic data population

## Background & Context

### Current State Analysis
Profico currently manages equipment through manual processes including Google Forms, Google Sheets, and an overly complex open-source solution. Key pain points include:
- No centralized equipment ownership tracking
- Missing invoices leading to accounting complications
- Time-consuming manual processes for equipment requests
- Inability to track equipment transfers between employees
- Lack of visibility into software subscriptions and associated costs
- No systematic approach to equipment lifecycle management or budgeting

### Stakeholder Landscape
**Primary Users:**
- **Employees (Regular Users)**: Need to register equipment, submit requests, and manage their assigned devices
- **Team Leads/Managers**: Require visibility into team equipment and first-level approval authority
- **Admin Users (Management)**: Need complete system oversight, reporting capabilities, and final approval authority
- **Accounting Team**: Require financial reports, invoice tracking, and audit-ready documentation

**Key Stakeholders:**
- **Operations Team**: Equipment procurement, device lifecycle management, and inventory oversight
- **Finance Team**: Budget planning, expense tracking, and compliance reporting
- **IT Team**: Technical requirements, system integration, and ongoing maintenance

### Strategic Rationale
With company growth projecting 300 employees within 3 years, manual processes are unsustainable. The system addresses immediate operational pain points while establishing scalable infrastructure for future growth. Financial compliance requirements and the need for accurate asset tracking for tax reporting make this system essential for business operations.
