# Team Spending Dashboard - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P1-High | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Teams lack visibility into spending patterns, making budget planning reactive and preventing data-driven decisions about team lunch frequency and restaurant choices.

### Solution Overview
Build comprehensive analytics dashboard showing team spending trends, budget insights, and actionable data for better financial planning while respecting individual privacy preferences.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 60% of teams use spending insights to adjust lunch frequency or budget allocations
**User Success**: Team managers can make informed budget decisions with clear spending data

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Access Dashboard** → Team tab shows spending overview → Current month summary with trends
2. **Explore Data** → Filter by time periods, categories → Detailed breakdowns and patterns
3. **Export Insights** → Generate reports for budget planning → Share with management or finance

**Key User Stories:**
- **As a team manager**, I want spending insights so that I can plan team budgets effectively
- **As a budget planner**, I want historical data so that I can forecast future expenses
- **As a team member**, I want transparency so that I can make informed spending choices

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Spending Overview**: Monthly/quarterly team totals, average per person, lunch frequency
- **Category Breakdown**: Spending by cuisine type, restaurant, price range
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical patterns, spending velocity, seasonal variations
- **Privacy Controls**: Individual opt-out options, aggregated data display
- **Time Filtering**: Flexible date ranges, comparison periods

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
