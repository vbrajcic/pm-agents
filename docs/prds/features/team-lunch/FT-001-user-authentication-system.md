# User Authentication System - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Users need secure access to the team lunch planner app with role-based permissions and protection of personal spending data. Without proper authentication, we cannot provide personalized experiences or maintain data privacy between teams.

### Solution Overview
Build a comprehensive authentication system supporting email/phone registration, secure login, multi-factor authentication, and user profile management that serves as the foundation for all other app features.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 95% of users complete registration within 3 minutes and maintain active sessions
**User Success**: Users feel confident their data is secure and can easily access their accounts across devices

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **New User Registration** ‚Üí Email/phone verification ‚Üí Account created with basic profile
2. **Returning User Login** ‚Üí Credential validation ‚Üí Secure session established
3. **Profile Management** ‚Üí Update preferences and security settings ‚Üí Changes saved and applied

**Key User Stories:**
- **As a new user**, I want to quickly create an account so that I can start using the lunch planner immediately
- **As a security-conscious user**, I want multi-factor authentication so that my spending data stays protected
- **As a returning user**, I want seamless login so that I can access my account without friction

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Registration Flow**: Email/phone-based signup with verification, password strength requirements
- **Authentication**: Secure login with JWT tokens, remember me functionality, automatic session management
- **Profile Management**: Basic user info, notification preferences, privacy settings
- **Security Features**: Password reset, account lockout protection, secure session handling

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: SMS or app-based 2FA for enhanced security
- **Social Login**: Google/Apple sign-in for faster onboarding
- **Device Management**: View and manage logged-in devices

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Enterprise SSO**: SAML/LDAP integration (future phase)
- **Advanced User Roles**: Complex permission systems (future phase)

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters, mix of letters/numbers/symbols
- **Session Management**: 30-day session expiry with refresh token rotation
- **Account Security**: 5 failed login attempts trigger temporary lockout
- **Data Privacy**: User can delete account and all associated data

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: User tries to register with existing email ‚Üí **Expected Behavior**: Clear error message with login option
- **Scenario**: Password reset token expires ‚Üí **User Experience**: New reset link required with clear instructions

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: Register, login, logout, update profile, change password, enable/disable 2FA
- **System Feedback**: Loading states during authentication, success confirmations, clear error messages
- **Navigation**: Smooth flow from auth screens to main app, profile accessible from settings
- **Visual Requirements**: Clean, trustworthy design that instills confidence in security

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: Spinner during login verification, progress indicators for registration steps
- **Empty States**: Helpful guidance for new users setting up their profiles
- **Error States**: Friendly, actionable error messages that guide users to resolution
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Touch-friendly forms, appropriate keyboard types, biometric login support

### Accessibility & Usability
- Screen reader support for all auth flows
- High contrast modes for login screens
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: All app features requiring user identification
**Dependencies**: Email/SMS service for verification
**Impacts**: Foundation for all other features - must be stable and scalable

### Security & Privacy
- **Access Control**: Users can only access their own data and associated team information
- **Data Sensitivity**: Passwords hashed, PII encrypted, session tokens secured
- **Audit Requirements**: Login attempts, password changes, profile updates logged
