# Payment Request & Tracking - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: High

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Teams lose money through forgotten reimbursements and lack payment accountability, creating financial friction and reducing trust in team lunch participation.

### Solution Overview
Build comprehensive payment request system with multi-platform integration, real-time tracking, and automated reminders to ensure 100% reimbursement completion.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 100% expense reimbursement completion rate vs. 60% baseline manual tracking
**User Success**: Users get paid back quickly without awkward follow-up conversations

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Generate Requests** → System creates payment requests for each participant → Sent via preferred platforms
2. **Track Status** → Real-time updates on payment completion → Visual dashboard of pending/completed
3. **Receive Payments** → Participants pay through integrated platforms → Automatic status updates

**Key User Stories:**
- **As someone who paid the bill**, I want easy payment requests so that I get reimbursed without chasing people
- **As someone who owes money**, I want clear payment instructions so that I can pay the right amount quickly
- **As a team member**, I want payment tracking so that I know my financial obligations are handled

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Multi-Platform Integration**: Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, Cash App payment request generation
- **Request Generation**: Automatic creation with context, custom messages, amount validation
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time payment status updates, completion notifications
- **Reminder System**: Automated follow-ups for overdue payments, escalation options
- **Manual Logging**: Cash and alternative payment method tracking

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Payment Analytics**: Track individual payment reliability, team payment patterns
- **Dispute Resolution**: Flag and manage payment disagreements
- **Bulk Operations**: Multiple payment requests for single events

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Direct Payment Processing**: In-app payment processing (future phase)
- **International Payments**: Cross-border payment support (future phase)

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Payment Validation**: Amounts must match bill split calculations exactly
- **Timeout Handling**: Overdue payments flagged after 48 hours
- **Status Accuracy**: Payment status updates within 5 minutes of completion
- **Request Limits**: Maximum 5 payment requests per day per user to prevent spam

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: Payment platform integration fails → **Expected Behavior**: Fallback to manual tracking with clear instructions
- **Scenario**: User disputes payment amount → **User Experience**: Dispute workflow with original bill split context

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: Payment request generation takes 2-3 seconds with progress indicators
- **Empty States**: Helpful guidance for users with no pending payments
- **Error States**: Clear communication when payment platforms are unavailable
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Touch-friendly payment tracking, notification integration

### Accessibility & Usability
- Screen reader support for payment status and tracking information
- High contrast mode for financial data and status indicators
- Voice notifications for payment completion updates
