# Restaurant Recommendation Engine - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: High

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Teams struggle to find restaurants that satisfy everyone's preferences, budget constraints, and dietary restrictions, leading to poor choices and reduced participation in team lunches.

### Solution Overview
Build an intelligent recommendation engine that considers team preferences, budget limits, dietary restrictions, and location to suggest optimal restaurants with detailed information for informed decision-making.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 90% of recommended restaurants result in successful team lunches with 4.2+ satisfaction rating
**User Success**: Users find restaurant suggestions that meet all their criteria without manual searching

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Generate Recommendations** → System analyzes preferences → Returns 3-5 ranked restaurant options
2. **Review Options** → See detailed info (menu, prices, ratings) → Compare against criteria
3. **Select Restaurant** → Choose preferred option → Proceed to invitation sending

**Key User Stories:**
- **As an organizer**, I want restaurants that fit our budget so that no one feels financially uncomfortable
- **As someone with dietary restrictions**, I want restaurants with suitable options so that I can participate fully
- **As a decision maker**, I want detailed restaurant information so that I can make informed choices

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Preference Filtering**: Cuisine type, price range, dietary restrictions, distance radius
- **Budget Enforcement**: Hard budget limits with per-person cost estimates
- **Location Intelligence**: GPS-based search with walking distance calculations
- **Restaurant Details**: Menus, photos, ratings, estimated wait times, contact information
- **Ranking Algorithm**: Score restaurants based on preference match and historical success

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Real-Time Data**: Current wait times, availability, special offers
- **Team History**: Learn from past choices and satisfaction ratings
- **Alternative Suggestions**: Options when primary criteria yield no results

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Reservation Integration**: Direct booking system (future phase)
- **Custom Menu Filtering**: Dish-level dietary analysis (future phase)

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Budget Compliance**: No restaurant suggestions above team's specified budget range
- **Dietary Requirements**: Must accommodate all specified dietary restrictions
- **Location Limits**: Default 1-mile radius, user-configurable up to 5 miles
- **Minimum Rating**: Restaurants must have 3.5+ stars with 10+ reviews
- **Data Freshness**: Restaurant data updated daily, prices within 30 days

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: No restaurants meet all criteria → **Expected Behavior**: Suggest relaxing one constraint with explanation
- **Scenario**: All nearby restaurants are too expensive → **User Experience**: Expand search radius or suggest budget adjustment

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: Browse recommendations, view restaurant details, filter/sort results, select restaurant
- **System Feedback**: Loading states during search, clear reasoning for recommendations, preference match indicators
- **Navigation**: Seamless flow from event creation to restaurant selection to invitation
- **Visual Requirements**: Restaurant photos, rating displays, budget indicators, distance/time information

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: Restaurant search takes 2-3 seconds with progress indication
- **Empty States**: Helpful guidance when no restaurants match criteria with suggestion to modify filters
- **Error States**: Clear communication when data is unavailable with fallback options
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Touch-friendly restaurant cards, swipe navigation, map integration

### Accessibility & Usability
- Screen reader support for all restaurant information and selection interface
- High contrast mode for price and rating displays
- Voice control for restaurant browsing and selection

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Required Inputs**: Location, budget range, cuisine preferences, dietary restrictions
- **Optional Inputs**: Group size, preferred dining time, special occasions
- **System Generated**: Recommendation scores, historical success rates, user feedback

**Data Display:**
- **Primary Information**: Restaurant name, cuisine type, price range, distance, rating
- **Secondary Information**: Menu highlights, dietary options, wait times, contact details
- **Contextual Data**: Team history with restaurant, previous satisfaction ratings

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: Team preferences, event parameters, historical dining data
- **Updates**: Restaurant recommendation success rates, user preference learning
- **Creates**: Restaurant selection records, preference pattern data

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: Event creation system, team preference management, invitation system
**Dependencies**: Restaurant data APIs (Google Places, Yelp), location services
**Impacts**: Event success rates, team satisfaction, future recommendation accuracy

### Security & Privacy
- **Access Control**: Team members can see recommendations for their events only
- **Data Sensitivity**: Location data requires user permission, dining history private to team
- **Audit Requirements**: Recommendation logic and selection patterns tracked for improvement
