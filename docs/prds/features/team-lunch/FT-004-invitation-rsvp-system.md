# Invitation & RSVP System - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: High

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Teams waste time with unclear lunch coordination and miss participation opportunities due to delayed or missed invitations. Current Slack-based coordination lacks RSVP tracking and real-time status updates.

### Solution Overview
Build a comprehensive invitation system with multi-channel delivery, real-time RSVP tracking, and status updates that keep organizers informed and participants engaged.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 85%+ RSVP response rate within 30 minutes of invitation
**User Success**: Zero missed lunch invitations, clear communication about attendance

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Send Invitations** → Organizer confirms event → System delivers invitations via multiple channels
2. **Receive & Respond** → Team members get notification → Quick RSVP with optional notes
3. **Track Status** → Real-time updates → Organizer sees response status and can make decisions

**Key User Stories:**
- **As an organizer**, I want to see real-time RSVP status so that I can proceed with restaurant booking
- **As a team member**, I want to quickly respond to lunch invites so that my attendance is confirmed
- **As a participant**, I want to provide context when declining so that organizers understand

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Multi-Channel Delivery**: Push notifications, email, in-app notifications for maximum reach
- **Quick RSVP Interface**: Accept/decline with one tap, optional notes for declines
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket-powered status updates, organizer dashboard with live counts
- **Decline Reasoning**: Optional text field for decline explanations
- **Status Dashboard**: Visual display of who's responded, pending, confirmed, declined

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Reminder System**: Automated follow-ups for non-responses
- **Response Modification**: Allow users to change RSVP after initial response
- **Notification Preferences**: User control over invitation delivery methods

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Alternative time suggestions (future phase)
- **External Integration**: Calendar event creation (future phase)

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Invitation Timing**: Invitations sent immediately after event creation
- **Response Deadline**: Default 2-hour response window for same-day events
- **Minimum Attendance**: Organizer alerted if responses fall below viable threshold
- **Status Persistence**: RSVP status saved permanently for event history

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: User receives invitation after event time passes → **Expected Behavior**: Invitation marked as expired with explanation
- **Scenario**: Notification delivery fails → **User Experience**: Retry mechanism with fallback to alternative channels

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: Accept/decline invitations, add decline notes, view event details
- **System Feedback**: Immediate confirmation of RSVP, real-time status updates
- **Navigation**: Quick access from home screen, integration with event details
- **Visual Requirements**: Clear status indicators, participant photos with response status

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: Instant RSVP feedback, loading states for status updates
- **Empty States**: Helpful guidance when no invitations are pending
- **Error States**: Clear communication when invitation delivery fails
- **Mobile/Responsive**: One-tap RSVP, swipe actions for quick responses

### Accessibility & Usability
- Screen reader support for all notification and response interfaces
- High contrast mode for status indicators
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick RSVP actions

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Required Inputs**: RSVP response (accept/decline), user response timestamp
- **Optional Inputs**: Decline reason text, response modification history
- **System Generated**: Invitation delivery status, response tracking, notification logs

**Data Display:**
- **Primary Information**: Response status per participant, overall attendance count
- **Secondary Information**: Response timing, decline reasons, delivery confirmation
- **Contextual Data**: Historical RSVP patterns, user reliability scores

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: Events, user profiles, notification preferences, team memberships
- **Updates**: Event attendance counts, user RSVP history
- **Creates**: Invitation records, response logs, notification delivery tracking

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: Event creation system, notification services, user authentication
**Dependencies**: Event data, user contact information, notification infrastructure
**Impacts**: Restaurant selection (headcount affects reservations)

### Security & Privacy
- **Access Control**: Only invited users can respond, organizers see all responses
- **Data Sensitivity**: Decline reasons private to organizer and respondent
- **Audit Requirements**: All invitation delivery and response activity logged
