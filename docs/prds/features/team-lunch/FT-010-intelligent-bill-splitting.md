# Intelligent Bill Splitting - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Teams struggle with fair bill splitting, leading to awkward conversations about separate checks, forgotten reimbursements, and math errors. Current manual splitting creates social friction and financial inequity.

### Solution Overview
Build smart bill splitting that handles equal splits and itemized breakdowns, automatically calculates tax/tip distribution, and creates clear payment requests for seamless reimbursement.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 100% of team lunches result in accurate, agreed-upon bill splits
**User Success**: No more awkward bill splitting conversations or forgotten reimbursements

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Choose Split Method** → Equal split or itemized breakdown → System calculates individual amounts
2. **Review Calculations** → See breakdown with tax/tip allocation → Adjust if needed
3. **Generate Requests** → Confirm participant amounts → Create payment requests for each person

**Key User Stories:**
- **As someone who paid the bill**, I want fair splitting so that everyone pays their appropriate share
- **As a participant**, I want to see exactly what I owe so that there's no confusion about amounts
- **As a group sharing appetizers**, I want intelligent itemized splitting so that shared items are divided fairly

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Split Methods**: Equal split among participants, itemized split by individual orders
- **Tax & Tip Distribution**: Proportional allocation based on subtotal amounts
- **Participant Selection**: Choose who attended from original invitation list
- **Calculation Engine**: Accurate math with rounding rules, real-time total validation
- **Preview System**: Show breakdown before finalizing with adjustment options

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Shared Item Handling**: Mark items as shared among specific participants
- **Custom Adjustments**: Manual amount modifications with reason tracking
- **Split Templates**: Save common splitting patterns for regular groups

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Complex Item Sharing**: Percentage-based item sharing (future phase)
- **Multiple Payment Methods**: Different people paying different portions (future phase)

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Mathematical Accuracy**: Individual amounts must sum to total within $0.01
- **Minimum Splits**: Cannot split bills less than $5 total
- **Participation Validation**: Only people who attended can be included in split
- **Rounding Rules**: Round individual amounts to nearest cent, absorb remainder in largest amount

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: Itemized split total doesn't match receipt total → **Expected Behavior**: Highlight discrepancy with option to adjust or use equal split
- **Scenario**: One person's order significantly higher than others → **User Experience**: Visual indication with option to confirm or discuss

## User Experience Requirements
