# Receipt Scanning & OCR - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: High

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Manual expense entry is time-consuming and error-prone, leading to incorrect bill splits and delayed reimbursements. Users currently type receipt details manually, creating math errors and missing items.

### Solution Overview
Build intelligent receipt scanning with OCR technology that automatically extracts all expense details, validates accuracy, and provides manual correction options for seamless expense entry.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 95%+ OCR accuracy reduces expense entry time by 80% (30 seconds vs 5+ minutes manual)
**User Success**: Users trust automatic expense detection and rarely need manual corrections

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Capture Receipt** → Camera opens with scanning guide → User takes photo of receipt
2. **Process & Extract** → OCR analyzes image → Structured data extracted with confidence scores
3. **Review & Confirm** → User reviews extracted data → Make corrections if needed → Confirm for bill splitting

**Key User Stories:**
- **As someone entering expenses**, I want to scan receipts so that I don't have to type everything manually
- **As a user splitting bills**, I want accurate item extraction so that bill splits are fair and correct
- **As someone with unclear receipts**, I want easy manual correction so that I can fix OCR errors quickly

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Camera Integration**: Native camera access with receipt scanning UI, image capture with retake options
- **OCR Processing**: Text extraction from receipt images, structured data parsing (merchant, date, items, amounts, tax, tip)
- **Data Validation**: Confidence scoring for extracted fields, automatic validation of mathematical accuracy
- **Manual Correction**: Edit interface for all extracted fields, line item addition/removal/modification
- **Fallback System**: Complete manual entry option when OCR fails

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Image Enhancement**: Auto-crop, rotation correction, brightness adjustment for better OCR
- **Receipt Templates**: Learning system for common restaurant formats
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple receipt scanning for complex meals

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Handwritten Receipt Support**: Focus on printed receipts only (future phase)
- **Foreign Language OCR**: English-only support initially (future phase)

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Fields below 80% confidence require user verification
- **Mathematical Validation**: Subtotal + tax + tip must equal total within $0.50 tolerance
- **Minimum Requirements**: Must extract merchant name, date, total amount for basic functionality
- **Image Quality**: Reject images below minimum resolution or clarity thresholds

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: Receipt image too blurry or damaged → **Expected Behavior**: Clear feedback with retake suggestion and manual entry option
- **Scenario**: OCR extracts incorrect total amount → **User Experience**: Validation error with highlighting and correction prompt

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: Take photo, retake if needed, review extracted data, edit fields, confirm accuracy
- **System Feedback**: Real-time camera focus guides, OCR processing indicators, confidence level displays
- **Navigation**: Smooth flow from camera to review to bill splitting
- **Visual Requirements**: Clear field highlighting, confidence indicators, error state markings

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: OCR processing takes 3-5 seconds with progress indicator
- **Empty States**: Helpful guidance for first-time receipt scanning users
- **Error States**: Clear communication when OCR fails with actionable next steps
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Camera optimized for mobile, touch-friendly editing interface

### Accessibility & Usability
- Voice-over support for OCR results and editing interface
- High contrast mode for receipt review and correction
- Large touch targets for mobile editing

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Required Inputs**: Receipt image, user confirmation of extracted data
- **Optional Inputs**: Manual corrections, additional context notes
- **System Generated**: OCR confidence scores, processing timestamps, image metadata

**Data Display:**
- **Primary Information**: Merchant name, date, total amount, itemized breakdown
- **Secondary Information**: Tax amount, tip, payment method, OCR confidence levels
- **Contextual Data**: Previous receipts from same merchant, typical spending patterns

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: Expense records, bill splitting system, merchant database
- **Updates**: Expense entry with structured data, user correction patterns for OCR improvement
- **Creates**: Receipt image record, extracted data structure, processing audit trail

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: Expense detection system, bill splitting engine, payment tracking
**Dependencies**: Cloud OCR service (Google Vision, AWS Textract), image storage
**Impacts**: Bill splitting accuracy depends on correct item and amount extraction

### Security & Privacy
- **Access Control**: Users can only scan receipts for their own expenses
- **Data Sensitivity**: Receipt images contain financial information, require encryption
- **Audit Requirements**: OCR processing attempts and accuracy metrics tracked

## Acceptance Criteria
