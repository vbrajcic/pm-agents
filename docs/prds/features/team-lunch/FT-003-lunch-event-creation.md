# Lunch Event Creation - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Teams spend 10+ minutes coordinating lunch through scattered Slack messages, often resulting in poor restaurant choices that don't consider everyone's budget or dietary preferences. This creates daily friction and reduces team participation.

### Solution Overview
Build an intelligent lunch planning wizard that captures team preferences, budget constraints, and availability upfront to streamline restaurant selection and maximize participation.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: Reduce lunch coordination time from 10+ minutes to under 2 minutes per event
**User Success**: 90% of created events result in successful team lunches with satisfied participants

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Initiate Planning** → "Plan New Lunch" button → Event creation wizard starts
2. **Set Parameters** → Select date, team members, budget, preferences → System validates inputs
3. **Generate Plan** → Review settings and create event → Event ready for restaurant selection

**Key User Stories:**
- **As a team organizer**, I want to set budget constraints upfront so that restaurant suggestions fit everyone's comfort zone
- **As a lunch planner**, I want to see team availability so that I can pick times that work for most people
- **As a team member**, I want my dietary preferences considered so that suggested restaurants have options I can enjoy

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Event Wizard**: Multi-step form for date/time, team selection, budget range, cuisine preferences
- **Team Selection**: Visual picker with profile photos, availability indicators, dietary preference summaries
- **Budget Controls**: Per-person budget slider with real-time total calculation
- **Preference Engine**: Cuisine selection (Italian, Asian, Mexican, etc.) with dietary filters integration
- **Validation System**: Date/time validation, minimum participant requirements, budget reasonableness checks

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Template System**: Save common team configurations for quick reuse
- **Smart Defaults**: Pre-populate based on user's recent lunch patterns
- **Availability Preview**: Calendar integration to show potential conflicts

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Multi-day event planning (future phase)
- **External Invites**: Non-team member invitation system (future phase)

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Minimum Participants**: Events require at least 2 team members
- **Budget Validation**: Per-person budget must be between $5-100 for reasonable restaurant options
- **Time Constraints**: Events can only be scheduled for future dates/times
- **Team Limits**: Maximum 20 participants per event for restaurant capacity

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: All selected team members have conflicting dietary restrictions → **Expected Behavior**: Warning with suggestion to adjust preferences or team selection
- **Scenario**: Budget range eliminates all nearby restaurants → **User Experience**: Budget adjustment suggestion with alternative ranges

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: Select date/time, choose team members, set budget slider, pick cuisine preferences, create event
- **System Feedback**: Real-time validation messages, participant count updates, budget total calculations
- **Navigation**: Clear progress through wizard steps, ability to go back and modify previous steps
- **Visual Requirements**: Team member photos for easy recognition, visual budget slider, preference tag system

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: Loading indicator while validating team availability and restaurant options
- **Empty States**: Helpful guidance for new users creating their first event
- **Error States**: Clear error messages with suggestions for resolution (e.g., "Try increasing budget range")
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Touch-friendly controls, appropriate input types, swipe navigation between wizard steps

### Accessibility & Usability
- Screen reader support for all form elements and controls
- Keyboard navigation through wizard steps
- High contrast mode for budget sliders and selection controls

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Required Inputs**: Event date/time, participating team members, budget range per person
- **Optional Inputs**: Cuisine preferences, special dietary considerations, custom event notes
- **System Generated**: Event ID, creation timestamp, organizer ID, initial status

**Data Display:**
- **Primary Information**: Event summary with date, team, budget, preferences
- **Secondary Information**: Participant count, total estimated cost, preference conflicts
- **Contextual Data**: Team member availability status, recent lunch history for context

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: User profiles for preferences, team memberships, calendar systems for availability
- **Updates**: User preference learning based on selections
- **Creates**: New event record ready for restaurant recommendation engine

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: User authentication, team management, restaurant recommendation engine
**Dependencies**: User profiles with preferences, team membership data
**Impacts**: Downstream restaurant selection and invitation systems

### Security & Privacy
- **Access Control**: Only team members can create events for their teams
- **Data Sensitivity**: Budget preferences treated as sensitive personal information
- **Audit Requirements**: Event creation and modification tracking for dispute resolution
