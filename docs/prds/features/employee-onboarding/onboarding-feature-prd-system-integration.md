# System Integration Hub - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: High

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Employee data currently exists in silos across multiple systems (BambooHR, Google Workspace, Slack, LMS, Payroll), requiring manual data entry and synchronization, leading to inconsistent information, access delays, and administrative overhead. New employees face fragmented system access without unified authentication.

### Solution Overview
A centralized system integration hub that automatically synchronizes employee data across all connected systems within 15 minutes, provides single sign-on (SSO) access, and maintains data consistency with comprehensive monitoring and error handling capabilities.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: Achieve 99.5% successful data synchronization rate and eliminate 90% of manual system provisioning tasks
**User Success**: New employees gain access to all work systems through single sign-on within 15 minutes of profile completion

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Employee profile created** → System triggers automatic data sync → All connected systems updated within 15 minutes
2. **Employee accesses any system** → SSO authenticates seamlessly → User gains appropriate access without separate logins
3. **Administrator monitors integrations** → System provides real-time status → Admin can identify and resolve sync issues immediately

**Key User Stories:**
- **As an IT administrator**, I want new employee data to automatically populate in all connected systems so that I can eliminate manual provisioning tasks
- **As an HR administrator**, I want employee information to sync between all systems so that data consistency is maintained without manual intervention
- **As a new employee**, I want single sign-on access to all my work systems so that I can start working immediately without managing multiple passwords

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Google Workspace Integration**: Automated email, calendar, and drive provisioning with appropriate organizational unit placement
- **BambooHR Synchronization**: Real-time bidirectional sync maintaining data consistency across employee records
- **Slack Integration**: Automatic channel assignment, team introductions, and profile setup based on department and role
- **Single Sign-On Implementation**: Seamless SSO across all integrated platforms with secure token management

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Learning Management System Integration**: Automatic training assignment and progress tracking based on role requirements
- **Payroll System Integration**: Secure direct deposit and tax information synchronization with payroll processing

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Custom System Integration**: Integration with company-specific legacy systems (requires separate assessment)
- **Advanced Data Analytics**: Complex integration performance analytics (covered by FT-007)

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Sync Timing**: Employee data must synchronize to all connected systems within 15 minutes of profile updates
- **Data Consistency**: Master data in employee profile system takes precedence with conflict resolution rules defined
- **Failed Integration Handling**: Failed integrations logged with automatic alerting and retry mechanisms activated
- **Access Provisioning**: System access granted based on role definitions with principle of least privilege

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: External system API unavailable → **Expected Behavior**: System queues sync requests and retries with exponential backoff
- **Scenario**: Data conflict between systems → **User Experience**: Admin dashboard shows conflicts with resolution workflow and manual override capability

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: SSO login, system access, integration status viewing (admin only), manual sync triggering (admin)
- **System Feedback**: Integration status indicators, sync completion notifications, error alerts with resolution guidance
- **Navigation**: Admin integration dashboard with system health monitoring and sync status visibility
- **Visual Requirements**: Clear status indicators (green/yellow/red) for integration health with detailed error information

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: SSO login within 3 seconds, integration status dashboard loads within 2 seconds
- **Empty States**: Clear setup guidance for new integrations and initial configuration requirements
- **Error States**: Specific error messaging for integration failures with troubleshooting steps and support escalation
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Admin dashboard accessible on mobile devices for urgent integration monitoring

### Accessibility & Usability
- **Accessibility**: Integration dashboard complies with WCAG 2.1 AA standards for admin users
- **Usability**: Intuitive SSO experience with clear error messaging and account recovery options

## Data & Integration

- **Secondary Information**: Detailed sync logs, API response data, performance metrics, troubleshooting information
- **Contextual Data**: Employee-specific sync status, role-based access assignments, department integration patterns

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: All integrated systems (Google Workspace, BambooHR, Slack, LMS, Payroll), employee profiles, role definitions
- **Updates**: System user accounts, access permissions, organizational structures, training assignments
- **Creates**: Integration logs, sync records, access audit trails, system provisioning history

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: Google Workspace APIs, BambooHR API, Slack API, Learning Management System APIs, Payroll system APIs
**Dependencies**: External system API access credentials, SSO provider configuration, network connectivity
**Impacts**: All other features requiring synchronized data (task workflow, notifications, analytics)

### Security & Privacy
- **Access Control**: Admin-level access for integration management; employees see only their SSO experience
- **Data Sensitivity**: API credentials and tokens secured with encryption and rotation policies
- **Audit Requirements**: All integration activities logged for security and compliance monitoring

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: Profile created → automatic sync triggered → all systems updated → SSO access confirmed
2. **Error Handling**: External system unavailable → sync queued → retry successful → admin notified of resolution
3. **Edge Cases**: Data conflict detected → conflict flagged → manual resolution → systems synchronized
4. **Integration**: New employee → all systems provisioned → training assigned → payroll configured

### Detailed User Flows

**Primary Flow - Automatic Data Synchronization:**
1. **Trigger Event**: Employee profile created or updated in master system
   - System context: Data change detected requiring propagation to integrated systems
   - Pre-conditions: Integration connections established and credentials validated

2. **Synchronization Process**: Automated data distribution with error handling
   - System identifies required sync targets → formats data for each system → initiates API calls
   - Success confirmation received → status updated → next integration processed
   - Error encountered → retry logic activated → admin notification if failures persist

3. **Completion and Monitoring**: Status updates and health monitoring
   - All systems synchronized successfully → status dashboard updated → completion logged
   - Any failures tracked → troubleshooting guidance provided → manual intervention options available

**Alternative Flows:**
- **SSO Authentication Flow**: User accesses system → SSO provider authenticates → appropriate system access granted → session established
- **Manual Sync Flow**: Admin identifies sync issue → triggers manual sync → monitors progress → confirms resolution
- **Error Resolution Flow**: Integration failure detected → admin notified → troubleshooting initiated → resolution implemented → sync resumed
