# Document Management System - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: High

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
New employees currently struggle with paper-based forms, manual document submission processes, and unclear completion requirements, leading to delays, lost documents, and compliance risks. HR administrators spend excessive time tracking document status and following up on missing paperwork.

### Solution Overview
A comprehensive digital document management system that enables mobile-responsive form completion, secure file storage with encryption, automated routing based on employee type, and real-time completion tracking with audit trails for compliance.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: Achieve 100% digital document completion and reduce HR administrative time by 60% through automated tracking and routing
**User Success**: New employees can complete all required documents from any device within 30 minutes with clear progress visibility

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Employee accesses document center** → System displays required vs. optional documents → User sees completion progress and priorities
2. **Employee completes forms digitally** → System validates and saves progress → User can resume from any device
3. **Employee submits completed documents** → System routes for approvals and stores securely → User receives confirmation and next steps

**Key User Stories:**
- **As a new employee**, I want to complete all required forms digitally from any device so that I can finish paperwork efficiently without printing or scanning
- **As an HR administrator**, I want all employee documents stored securely with audit trails so that I can ensure compliance and reduce manual tracking
- **As a compliance officer**, I want to track document completion rates and missing items so that I can ensure regulatory compliance and identify process bottlenecks

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Digital Form Builder**: Dynamic form creation with validation, e-signature capability, and mobile-responsive design
- **Secure File Storage**: Encrypted document upload, storage, and retrieval with role-based access controls
- **Automated Form Routing**: Rule-based document routing by employee type, department, and compliance requirements
- **Version Control & Audit System**: Complete document versioning with audit trails for all access and modifications

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Document Templates**: Pre-built templates for standard forms (offer letters, contracts, tax forms) with customization capabilities
- **Cloud Storage Integration**: Secure integration with enterprise cloud storage providers for scalable document management

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Advanced Workflow Designer**: Visual workflow builder for complex approval processes (future phase)
- **AI Document Processing**: Automated document analysis and data extraction (future enhancement)

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Mobile Accessibility**: All forms must be fully functional on mobile devices with touch-optimized interfaces
- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Document completion status updated immediately with dashboard visibility for all stakeholders
- **Compliance Auditing**: Audit trails must capture all document access, modifications, and approvals with timestamp and user identification
- **Security Requirements**: End-to-end encryption for document transmission and storage with data retention policy enforcement

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: Form submission failure → **Expected Behavior**: System saves progress locally and provides clear retry mechanism with support contact
- **Scenario**: Document upload size limit exceeded → **User Experience**: Clear error message with file size requirements and compression guidance

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements

- **System Feedback**: Real-time form validation, progress indicators, completion confirmation, and error messaging with resolution steps
- **Navigation**: Document center dashboard with completion status, search functionality, and categorized document organization
- **Visual Requirements**: Mobile-first responsive design, accessibility compliance, and consistent visual styling with main portal

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: Form loads within 2 seconds with skeleton screens, upload progress indicators for large files
- **Empty States**: Clear guidance for employees with no pending documents and celebration of completion milestones
- **Error States**: Specific validation errors with inline messaging and clear instructions for resolution
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Full document completion functionality on iOS and Android with optimized touch interfaces

### Accessibility & Usability

- **System Generated**: Document IDs, version numbers, audit timestamps, routing decisions, completion statistics

**Data Display:**
- **Primary Information**: Document title, completion status, due date, required vs. optional designation, progress percentage
- **Secondary Information**: Document history, approval status, version information, related form dependencies
- **Contextual Data**: Role-specific requirements, department-specific forms, compliance deadline information

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: Employee profile data, manager assignments, HR approval workflows, compliance tracking systems
- **Updates**: Document completion statistics, compliance reporting, employee onboarding progress
- **Creates**: Document records, approval workflows, audit trails, completion certificates

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: Employee profile system (FT-001), task workflow engine (FT-002), notification system (FT-006), cloud storage providers
**Dependencies**: Employee profile data for form pre-population, manager hierarchy for approval routing
**Impacts**: Compliance reporting, task workflow dependencies, onboarding progress calculations

### Security & Privacy

2. **Form Completion Process**: Step-by-step digital form completion with validation
   - User selects document → form loads with pre-populated data → completes required fields
   - Real-time validation and progress saving → file uploads as needed → e-signature placement
   - Document review screen → final submission → confirmation and next steps

3. **Post-Submission Processing**: Automated routing and storage with notifications
   - System routes for required approvals → secure storage with encryption → audit trail creation
   - Completion notifications to relevant parties → task workflow updates → progress dashboard refresh

**Alternative Flows:**
