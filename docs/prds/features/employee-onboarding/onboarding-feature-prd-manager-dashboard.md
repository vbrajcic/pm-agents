# Manager Dashboard & Oversight - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P1-High | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Hiring managers and team leads currently lack visibility into their team members' onboarding progress, leading to missed check-ins, delayed support, and inconsistent oversight. Manual tracking methods create administrative burden and reactive rather than proactive management approaches.

### Solution Overview
A comprehensive manager dashboard that provides real-time visibility into direct report onboarding progress, automated check-in scheduling based on milestones, escalation alerts for overdue tasks, and bulk management capabilities for efficient team oversight.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: Reduce manager oversight time by 50% while increasing onboarding success rates through proactive support and early intervention
**User Success**: Managers have complete visibility into team member progress and can provide timely support when needed

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Manager accesses dashboard** → System displays team member progress overview → User sees immediate status and action items
2. **Manager reviews individual progress** → System shows detailed task status and timeline → User identifies support needs and next steps
3. **Manager takes action** → System facilitates check-ins, approvals, or escalations → User maintains oversight without administrative burden

**Key User Stories:**
- **As a hiring manager**, I want visibility into team member onboarding progress so that I can provide timely support and ensure successful integration
- **As a manager**, I want structured check-in scheduling and oversight capabilities so that I can maintain regular contact without manual calendar management
- **As a department head**, I want to monitor onboarding efficiency across my team so that I can identify bottlenecks and improve processes

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Progress Overview Dashboard**: Real-time progress visualization for all direct reports with status indicators and completion percentages
- **Individual Progress Tracking**: Detailed task-level view for each team member with timeline, dependencies, and completion status
- **Automated Check-in Scheduling**: Calendar integration that automatically schedules check-ins based on onboarding milestones
- **Escalation Alert System**: Proactive notifications for overdue tasks, blocked progress, and employees needing support

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Bulk Actions Interface**: Batch operations for approving tasks, scheduling meetings, or sending messages to multiple team members
- **Progress Analytics**: Team-level analytics showing onboarding patterns, success rates, and time-to-productivity metrics

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Performance Review Integration**: Connection to formal performance management systems (future phase)
- **Advanced Team Analytics**: Complex predictive analytics and machine learning insights (future enhancement)

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Access Control**: Managers can only view progress for their direct reports as defined in organizational hierarchy
- **Automated Scheduling**: Check-in meetings automatically scheduled at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 30 days unless manually overridden
- **Escalation Triggers**: Alerts generated for tasks overdue by 48+ hours or employees with less than 50% completion at week 2
- **Real-time Updates**: Dashboard data refreshes every 5 minutes to ensure current information availability

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: Manager-employee relationship changes during onboarding → **Expected Behavior**: Dashboard access transfers automatically with notification to both managers
- **Scenario**: Check-in scheduling conflicts with existing meetings → **User Experience**: System suggests alternative times and allows manual rescheduling

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: Progress viewing, task approval, check-in scheduling, message sending, bulk operations, filtering and sorting
- **System Feedback**: Real-time progress updates, completion notifications, alert indicators, and action confirmations
- **Navigation**: Integrated dashboard with team overview, individual drill-down, and quick action buttons
- **Visual Requirements**: Clear progress indicators, status color coding, mobile-responsive design, and intuitive data visualization

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: Dashboard loads within 2 seconds with skeleton screens for individual progress details
- **Empty States**: Clear guidance for new managers with no direct reports and celebration of team completion milestones
- **Error States**: Clear messaging for sync issues or system unavailability with refresh options and support contact
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Full oversight functionality on mobile devices for managers working remotely or traveling

### Accessibility & Usability
- **Accessibility**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with screen reader support for all dashboard elements
- **Usability**: Intuitive navigation with minimal clicks to access key information and complete common management tasks

4. **Integration**: Task completed → progress updated → manager notified → check-in scheduled if milestone reached

### Detailed User Flows

**Primary Flow - Progress Oversight:**
1. **Entry Point**: Manager accesses dashboard from main navigation or direct link
   - User context: Manager needs to monitor team member onboarding and provide support
   - Pre-conditions: Manager-employee relationships defined, onboarding workflows active

2. **Progress Review Process**: Comprehensive team and individual progress assessment
   - Dashboard overview shows team status → select individual for details → review task progress
   - Identify support needs or blockers → take action (approve, schedule meeting, send message)
   - Update personal notes → schedule follow-up → return to team overview

3. **Proactive Management Actions**: Scheduled and triggered management activities
   - Receive escalation alerts → assess situation → provide support or escalate further
   - Automated check-in reminders → conduct meetings → update progress notes → plan next steps

**Alternative Flows:**
- **Bulk Management Flow**: Select multiple team members → choose bulk action → configure settings → execute across selection → confirm completion
- **Escalation Response Flow**: Alert received → investigate issue → contact employee or HR → resolve blocker → document resolution → monitor progress
- **Check-in Scheduling Flow**: Milestone reached → automatic scheduling → confirm timing → send invitations → conduct meeting → record outcomes
