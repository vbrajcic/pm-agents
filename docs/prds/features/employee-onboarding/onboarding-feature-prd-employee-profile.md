# Employee Profile Management - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: High

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
New employees currently face delayed account provisioning and manual profile setup across multiple systems, creating a fragmented and time-consuming onboarding experience. This leads to productivity delays, IT administrative overhead, and poor first impressions for new hires.

### Solution Overview
An automated employee profile management system that creates comprehensive employee profiles and triggers automated account provisioning across all connected systems (Google Workspace, Slack, file systems) within 5 minutes of profile completion.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: Reduce IT provisioning time by 80% and achieve automated account creation for 95% of new employees within 5 minutes
**User Success**: New employees can complete profile setup in under 15 minutes and receive all system access within 10 minutes

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Employee accesses profile creation form** → System displays step-by-step wizard → User sees guided profile creation interface
2. **Employee completes required information** → System validates in real-time → User receives immediate feedback on data quality
3. **Employee submits profile** → System triggers automated provisioning → User receives welcome email with all account credentials within 10 minutes

**Key User Stories:**
- **As a new employee**, I want to create my profile once and have all necessary accounts automatically provisioned so that I can start working immediately
- **As an HR administrator**, I want to input basic employee information and trigger automated account creation so that I can eliminate manual provisioning tasks
- **As an IT administrator**, I want new employee accounts automatically created with appropriate permissions so that I can focus on strategic initiatives rather than routine provisioning

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Profile Creation Form**: Step-by-step wizard with validation, required field enforcement, and mobile-responsive design
- **Automated Account Provisioning**: Real-time account creation for Google Workspace, Slack, and file system access with role-based permissions
- **BambooHR Integration**: Bidirectional synchronization ensuring data consistency across systems
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Automatic permission assignment based on department, job function, and employment type

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Profile Photo & Badge Coordination**: Camera integration for photo capture and security badge workflow coordination
- **Emergency Contact Management**: Secure collection and storage of emergency contact information with appropriate access controls

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Performance Reviews**: Integration with performance management systems (future phase)
- **Payroll Integration**: Direct payroll system connection (handled separately by FT-004)

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Automated Provisioning Timing**: Profile submission must trigger account creation within 5 minutes for 95% of cases
- **Permission Assignment**: Role-based permissions automatically assigned based on department mapping and job function requirements
- **Data Validation**: All required fields validated before submission with clear error messaging and guidance
- **GDPR Compliance**: Personal data collection, storage, and processing must comply with GDPR requirements

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: BambooHR sync failure → **Expected Behavior**: System queues retry attempts and notifies HR administrators of sync issues
- **Scenario**: Account provisioning failure → **User Experience**: User receives notification of delay with expected resolution timeline and manual backup process

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: Step-by-step form completion, photo upload, emergency contact entry, profile review and submission
- **System Feedback**: Real-time validation, progress indicators, success confirmation, and error messaging with clear resolution steps
- **Navigation**: Seamless integration with existing onboarding portal navigation and return-to-complete functionality
- **Visual Requirements**: Mobile-responsive design, accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA), and consistent visual styling

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: Clear progress indicators during account provisioning with estimated completion time
- **Empty States**: Guidance for incomplete profiles with clear next steps and save-for-later functionality
- **Error States**: Specific error messaging with actionable resolution steps and support contact information
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Full functionality on iOS and Android devices with touch-optimized interface

### Accessibility & Usability

**Data Display:**
- **Primary Information**: Profile summary with photo, contact details, role information, and account status
- **Secondary Information**: Emergency contacts, permission details, account creation history, and sync status
- **Contextual Data**: Department-specific requirements, role-based form sections, and regional compliance fields

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: BambooHR employee records, Google Workspace accounts, Slack user profiles, file system permissions
- **Updates**: Employee master record, account provisioning status, permission assignments
- **Creates**: Employee profile record, account provisioning logs, role-permission mappings

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: BambooHR (employee records), Google Workspace (email/calendar), Slack (team assignment), file systems (access permissions)
**Dependencies**: External system API access, authentication infrastructure, role management system
**Impacts**: Task workflow system (employee data required), notification system (contact information)

### Security & Privacy
- **Access Control**: Employees can edit own profiles; HR can view/edit all profiles; IT can view account status
- **Data Sensitivity**: Personal information encrypted at rest and in transit with access logging
- **Audit Requirements**: All profile creation, updates, and account provisioning activities logged for compliance
