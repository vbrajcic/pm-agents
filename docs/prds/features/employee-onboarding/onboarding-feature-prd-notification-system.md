# Notification & Communication System - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P1-High | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
New employees and managers currently miss important onboarding milestones and deadlines due to lack of automated notifications and reminders, leading to delayed task completion, missed check-ins, and inconsistent communication throughout the onboarding process.

### Solution Overview
A comprehensive notification and communication system that delivers timely reminders via email, in-app notifications, and SMS, with intelligent escalation workflows and user-configurable preferences to ensure critical onboarding milestones are never missed.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: Reduce missed deadlines by 80% and increase on-time task completion to 95% through proactive notification delivery
**User Success**: All stakeholders receive relevant, timely notifications through their preferred channels with clear action items

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **System detects notification trigger** → Determines recipient and urgency → Selects appropriate delivery channel
2. **User receives notification** → Views clear action item and context → Takes action or acknowledges receipt
3. **System tracks response** → Updates notification status → Triggers escalation if no response within defined timeframe

**Key User Stories:**
- **As a new employee**, I want timely reminders about upcoming tasks and deadlines so that I can stay on track with my onboarding progress
- **As an HR administrator**, I want automatic notifications for onboarding milestones so that I can intervene when employees need support
- **As a manager**, I want alerts when team members have overdue tasks or need assistance so that I can provide timely support

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Multi-Channel Delivery**: Email, in-app, and SMS notification delivery with channel selection based on urgency and user preferences
- **Smart Reminder System**: Intelligent scheduling based on task priority, deadlines, and user behavior patterns
- **Escalation Workflow**: Automated escalation to managers and HR for overdue tasks with configurable escalation rules
- **Notification Preferences**: User-configurable settings for notification types, channels, and frequency

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **In-App Notification Center**: Centralized notification history and management within the application
- **Notification Analytics**: Delivery rates, engagement metrics, and effectiveness tracking for optimization

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Push Notifications**: Native mobile app push notifications (covered by FT-008)
- **Advanced AI Personalization**: Machine learning-based notification optimization (future enhancement)

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Delivery Timing**: Notifications delivered within 5 minutes of trigger events with guaranteed delivery confirmation
- **Channel Selection**: Critical notifications use multiple channels; routine notifications respect user preferences
- **Escalation Rules**: Overdue task notifications escalate to managers after 24 hours, to HR after 48 hours
- **Frequency Control**: Maximum 3 notifications per day per user unless marked as critical or emergency

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: Email delivery failure → **Expected Behavior**: System attempts SMS delivery and logs failure for admin review
- **Scenario**: User opts out of all notifications → **User Experience**: Critical onboarding notifications still delivered with clear opt-out explanation

## User Experience Requirements

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: Task deadline approaches → notification sent → user completes task → confirmation received
2. **Error Handling**: Email delivery fails → SMS backup triggered → delivery confirmed → user receives notification
3. **Edge Cases**: User opts out of notifications → critical onboarding notification still sent → clear explanation provided
4. **Integration**: Task overdue → escalation triggered → manager notified → HR notified if no response → resolution tracked

### Detailed User Flows

**Primary Flow - Notification Delivery:**
1. **Trigger Event**: System detects notification-worthy event (task deadline, milestone, overdue item)
   - System context: Event requires stakeholder notification based on business rules
   - Pre-conditions: User preferences configured, delivery channels operational

2. **Notification Processing**: Channel selection and content preparation
   - System evaluates urgency and user preferences → selects delivery channel → formats content
   - Delivers notification via chosen channel → confirms delivery → logs status
   - Tracks user engagement → updates notification status → triggers follow-up if needed

3. **User Response and Follow-up**: User interaction and system response
   - User receives and views notification → takes action or acknowledges → system updates status
   - If no response within timeframe → escalation rules activated → higher-level notifications sent

**Alternative Flows:**
- **Escalation Flow**: No response to initial notification → wait period expires → escalation triggered → manager/HR notified → resolution tracking begins
- **Preference Update Flow**: User accesses preferences → modifies settings → changes saved → new rules applied to future notifications
- **Failure Recovery Flow**: Primary channel fails → backup channel activated → delivery attempted → success logged or further escalation triggered
