# Task Workflow Engine - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: High

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
New employees currently receive unclear, inconsistent task assignments without visibility into progress or dependencies, leading to confusion, missed deadlines, and manager frustration. The lack of automated workflow management creates administrative overhead and inconsistent onboarding experiences across departments.

### Solution Overview
An intelligent task workflow engine that automatically assigns role-specific onboarding tasks with dependency management, progress tracking, and manager oversight capabilities, ensuring every new employee receives a structured, consistent onboarding experience.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: Achieve 95% on-time task completion rates and reduce manager oversight time by 60% through automated progress tracking
**User Success**: New employees always know their next steps with clear deadlines, and managers have real-time visibility into team member progress

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Employee views task dashboard** → System displays prioritized task list with deadlines → User sees clear next steps and progress
2. **Employee completes tasks** → System updates status and unlocks dependencies → User sees immediate progress and new available tasks
3. **Manager reviews team progress** → System shows aggregated status and alerts → Manager takes action on blockers or provides support

**Key User Stories:**
- **As a new employee**, I want to see exactly what tasks I need to complete and when so that I can stay on track and feel confident about my progress
- **As a manager**, I want to see my team member's onboarding progress and required actions so that I can provide timely support and ensure success
- **As an HR administrator**, I want to define role-specific onboarding workflows so that every employee receives consistent, appropriate task assignments

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Task Template System**: Pre-defined task templates based on employee type (full-time, part-time, contractor) and role (sales, marketing, development, operations)
- **Dependency Management**: Tasks automatically become available only when prerequisites are completed, with clear dependency visualization
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates (not started, in progress, completed, overdue) with completion timestamps and audit trails
- **Manager Approval Workflow**: Tasks requiring manager approval with revision request capabilities and approval notifications

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Calendar Integration**: Automatic meeting scheduling for required check-ins and training sessions
- **Custom Task Management**: Ability to add ad-hoc tasks and customize workflows for specific situations

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Performance Review Integration**: Connection to performance management systems (future phase)
- **Advanced Analytics**: Complex workflow optimization analytics (covered by FT-007)

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Task Assignment**: Tasks automatically assigned based on employee profile data (department, role, employment type) within 1 hour of profile creation
- **Dependency Resolution**: Dependent tasks remain hidden until all prerequisites are marked complete with manager approval if required
- **Overdue Escalation**: Tasks overdue by 24+ hours trigger notifications to employee, manager, and HR with escalation workflow
- **Completion Validation**: Critical tasks require manager approval before marking complete, with revision request capabilities

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: Manager unavailable for approval → **Expected Behavior**: System escalates to backup approver or HR with notification trail
- **Scenario**: Task dependency cycle detected → **User Experience**: System prevents cycle creation and provides clear error messaging with resolution options

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: Task viewing, status updates, file uploads, comment addition, approval requests, manager approvals
- **System Feedback**: Real-time progress updates, completion notifications, overdue alerts, dependency status changes
- **Navigation**: Integrated task dashboard with filtering (by status, deadline, category), search functionality, and mobile optimization
- **Visual Requirements**: Progress visualization with timeline view, completion percentages, and clear priority indicators

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: Task list loads within 2 seconds with skeleton screens during data loading
- **Empty States**: Clear guidance for new employees with no available tasks and completed state celebration
- **Error States**: Clear messaging for failed task submissions with retry options and support contact information
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Full task management functionality on mobile devices with touch-optimized interactions

### Accessibility & Usability
- **Accessibility**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with screen reader support for all task management functions
- **Usability**: Intuitive task completion flow with minimal clicks and clear progress indicators

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Required Inputs**: Task completion status, completion timestamps, manager approval decisions, employee comments and file uploads
- **Optional Inputs**: Task notes, estimated completion time, priority adjustments, custom due dates
- **System Generated**: Task assignment timestamps, dependency relationships, overdue flags, escalation triggers

**Data Display:**
- **Primary Information**: Task title, description, due date, status, progress indicators, and next steps
- **Secondary Information**: Task history, approval status, dependency information, and related resources
- **Contextual Data**: Role-specific instructions, department guidelines, and completion examples

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: Employee profile data, manager assignments, calendar events, document attachments
- **Updates**: Task completion statistics, progress reports, escalation status
- **Creates**: Task completion records, approval workflows, progress milestones

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: Employee profile system (FT-001), calendar systems (Google Calendar, Outlook), notification system (FT-006), manager dashboard (FT-005)
**Dependencies**: Employee profile data for task assignment, manager hierarchy for approval workflows
**Impacts**: Analytics reporting (FT-007), notification triggers across all systems

### Security & Privacy
- **Access Control**: Employees see own tasks; managers see direct report tasks; HR sees all tasks with appropriate filtering
- **Data Sensitivity**: Task completion data and manager feedback protected with role-based access
- **Audit Requirements**: All task assignments, completions, and approvals logged for compliance and reporting

## Acceptance Criteria

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: Employee completes tasks in order → dependencies unlock → manager approves → progress updates
2. **Error Handling**: Manager unavailable for approval → escalation triggers → backup approver notified → workflow continues
3. **Edge Cases**: Circular dependency creation attempt → system prevents → clear error message → alternative dependency suggested
4. **Integration**: Task completion → calendar meeting scheduled → notification sent → dashboard updated

### Detailed User Flows

**Primary Flow - Task Completion:**
1. **Entry Point**: Employee accesses task dashboard from onboarding portal
   - User context: New employee needs to understand required onboarding tasks
   - Pre-conditions: Employee profile created, tasks assigned based on role and department

2. **Task Management Process**: Sequential task completion with dependency awareness
   - User views prioritized task list → selects next available task → completes requirements
   - Upload files or provide information → submit for approval if required → track progress
   - Receive feedback from manager → make revisions if needed → mark task complete

3. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates and milestone recognition
   - Progress indicators update automatically → dependent tasks become available
   - Completion milestones celebrated → manager dashboard updates → next phase tasks assigned

**Alternative Flows:**
- **Manager Approval Flow**: Task submitted → manager notified → review and approve/reject → feedback to employee → task status updated
- **Overdue Task Flow**: Deadline passed → escalation notifications → manager and HR alerted → support provided
- **Custom Task Flow**: Manager adds ad-hoc task → employee notified → completion tracked → integrated into overall progress
