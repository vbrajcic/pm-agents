# Real-Time Budget Tracking - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Traditional budgeting fails because users only discover overspending after it happens, leading to budget abandonment and financial stress. Monthly budget reviews are too late to prevent poor spending decisions.

### Solution Overview
Build real-time budget tracking with instant spending updates, visual progress indicators, and immediate feedback that helps users stay within budget through proactive awareness.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: Increase budget adherence from 23% (industry average) to 80% through real-time visibility
**User Success**: Users stay within budget categories and reduce overspending incidents

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Budget Setup** → Create monthly budgets by category → Set spending limits → Choose visual preferences
2. **Real-Time Tracking** → Transactions post → Budget automatically updates → Visual progress shows status
3. **Budget Management** → Review category performance → Adjust allocations → Monitor trends

**Key User Stories:**
- **As someone trying to control spending**, I want real-time budget tracking so that I know when I'm approaching limits
- **As a visual learner**, I want clear progress indicators so that I can see my budget status at a glance
- **As someone who overspends**, I want immediate feedback so that I can course-correct before problems compound

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Dynamic Budget Creation**: Category-based monthly budgets with custom amounts, rollover options, emergency overrides
- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Instant budget updates within 5 minutes of transaction posting, visual progress bars with color coding
- **Visual Status Indicators**: Green/yellow/red progress bars, percentage completion, remaining amounts, overspend warnings
- **Budget Adjustment Tools**: Easy reallocation between categories, mid-month adjustments, automatic rollover handling

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Historical Budget Analysis**: Month-over-month comparison, seasonal pattern recognition, accuracy improvement tracking
- **Smart Budget Suggestions**: AI-powered budget recommendations based on spending history and goals

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Envelope Budgeting**: Complex allocation methods beyond category-based budgeting (future phase)
- **Multi-User Budgets**: Shared household budgeting with multiple users (future phase)

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Update Speed**: Budget progress updates within 5 minutes of transaction categorization
- **Calculation Accuracy**: Precise budget math with proper handling of pending transactions and adjustments
- **Rollover Logic**: Unused budget amounts can optionally roll to next month or designated savings
- **Emergency Overrides**: Users can temporarily exceed budgets with acknowledgment and recovery planning

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: Transaction categorization changes after budget calculated → **Expected Behavior**: Immediate budget recalculation with clear change notification
- **Scenario**: User deletes budget category mid-month → **User Experience**: Confirmation dialog with reallocation options for existing spending

## User Experience Requirements
