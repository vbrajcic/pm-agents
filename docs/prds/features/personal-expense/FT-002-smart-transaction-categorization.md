# Smart Transaction Categorization - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: High

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Manual expense categorization is time-consuming and inconsistent, leading to inaccurate budgets and poor financial insights. Users abandon tracking when faced with categorizing hundreds of transactions monthly.

### Solution Overview
Build intelligent ML-powered categorization that automatically classifies 90%+ of transactions accurately while learning from user corrections to improve over time.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 90% categorization accuracy within 30 days, 80% reduction in manual categorization time
**User Success**: Users trust automatic categorization and rarely need manual corrections

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Automatic Categorization** → Transaction imported → ML engine analyzes → Category assigned with confidence score
2. **Review & Correct** → User sees categorized transactions → Quick correction if needed → System learns from feedback
3. **Category Management** → Custom categories created → Rules established → Bulk operations performed

**Key User Stories:**
- **As someone who wants accurate budgets**, I want smart categorization so that my expenses are properly classified automatically
- **As a detail-oriented person**, I want to correct categorization errors so that my financial data stays accurate

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **ML Categorization Engine**: 90%+ accuracy using merchant, amount, description analysis with confidence scoring
- **User Correction Interface**: One-tap category changes, bulk categorization tools, learning feedback integration
- **Custom Category Support**: User-defined categories, category rules, subcategory hierarchies
- **Confidence Scoring**: Visual indicators for categorization certainty, flagging low-confidence transactions

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Smart Rules Engine**: User-defined categorization rules based on merchant, amount, or description patterns
- **Bulk Operations**: Mass categorization updates, category merging, historical recategorization

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Receipt-Based Categorization**: OCR analysis of receipt images (future phase)
- **Location-Based Rules**: GPS categorization based on transaction location (future phase)

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Accuracy Threshold**: Transactions below 80% confidence require user review
- **Learning Integration**: User corrections immediately update ML models for future transactions
- **Category Consistency**: Standard categories align with budgeting best practices, custom categories integrate seamlessly
- **Historical Application**: Category changes can be applied retroactively with user confirmation

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: Merchant name changes or transaction format varies → **Expected Behavior**: System recognizes pattern variations and maintains accurate categorization
- **Scenario**: User creates conflicting categorization rules → **User Experience**: Clear conflict resolution with rule priority guidance

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: Review suggested categories, make corrections, create custom categories, set categorization rules
- **System Feedback**: Confidence indicators, learning confirmations, bulk operation progress, rule conflict warnings
- **Navigation**: Quick access from transaction lists, dedicated category management section
- **Visual Requirements**: Color-coded categories, confidence level indicators, correction history display

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: Categorization occurs instantly, bulk operations show progress indicators
- **Empty States**: Guidance for new users on category setup and customization options
- **Error States**: Clear explanations when categorization fails with manual override options
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Swipe gestures for quick corrections, touch-friendly category selection

### Accessibility & Usability
- Screen reader support for category names and confidence levels
- High contrast mode for category visual indicators
- Keyboard shortcuts for frequent categorization actions

## Data & Integration
