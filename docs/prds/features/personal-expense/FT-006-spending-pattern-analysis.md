# Spending Pattern Analysis - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P1-High | **Complexity Estimate**: High

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Users need actionable insights into their personal spending habits to make informed financial decisions and identify optimization opportunities. Without pattern analysis, users struggle to understand where their money goes and how to improve their financial behavior.

### Solution Overview
We're building an intelligent analytics engine that identifies spending patterns across time, location, and categories, providing behavioral insights and actionable recommendations for financial improvement.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: Users who engage with spending insights show 15% improvement in budget adherence and 20% better goal achievement rates
**User Success**: Users can identify at least 3 specific optimization opportunities monthly and understand their money habits clearly

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **User Opens Insights** → System analyzes spending history → User sees personalized spending patterns dashboard
2. **User Reviews Trends** → System highlights behavioral patterns → User gets specific recommendations
3. **User Acts on Insights** → System tracks behavioral changes → User sees improvement metrics

**Key User Stories:**
- **As someone who wants to improve finances**, I want spending pattern insights so that I can understand my money habits and find ways to optimize
- **As a data-driven person**, I want detailed analytics so that I can identify specific optimization opportunities and track improvements

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Pattern Detection**: Identify time-based, location-based, and category-based spending trends with statistical significance
- **Behavioral Insights**: Generate habit identification and spending velocity analysis with confidence scoring
- **Trend Analysis**: Provide month-over-month comparisons and seasonal pattern recognition
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast spending based on historical patterns with 85% accuracy

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Peer Benchmarking**: Anonymous comparison with similar demographic groups
- **Advanced Recommendations**: ML-powered suggestions for spending optimization
- **Insight Personalization**: Customized analysis based on user goals and preferences

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Investment Analysis**: Focus remains on expense patterns, not investment performance
- **Credit Score Integration**: Spending analysis only, not credit monitoring

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Pattern Significance**: Only surface patterns with statistical confidence >80% to avoid misleading insights
- **Data Privacy**: All analysis must respect user privacy settings and anonymize any comparative data
- **Insight Freshness**: Update patterns daily but only notify users of significant changes to avoid alert fatigue

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Insufficient Data**: When <30 days of transactions exist → **Expected Behavior**: Show limited insights with data collection guidance
- **Seasonal Variance**: When patterns show high seasonal variation → **User Experience**: Explain seasonality and provide normalized trends

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **Insight Dashboard**: Interactive charts showing spending trends across multiple time periods and categories
- **Pattern Highlights**: Key insights presented as digestible cards with clear action items
- **Drill-Down Capability**: Ability to explore specific patterns with transaction-level detail
- **Comparison Views**: Side-by-side analysis of different time periods or categories

### User Experience Considerations
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with high-level insights, allow drilling into details
- **Actionable Format**: Present insights with specific, achievable recommendations
- **Context Awareness**: Explain why patterns matter and how they relate to user goals
- **Visual Clarity**: Use color coding and clear charts that are accessible to non-technical users

### Accessibility & Usability
- **Chart Accessibility**: All visualizations include text alternatives and keyboard navigation
- **Color Independence**: Insights are understandable without relying solely on color coding
- **Mobile Optimization**: Full functionality available on mobile devices with touch-friendly interactions

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Transaction History**: Minimum 30 days for basic patterns, 12 months for seasonal analysis
- **Categorization Data**: All transactions must be categorized for meaningful pattern analysis
- **Location Data**: GPS coordinates when available for location-based insights
- **Time Stamps**: Precise transaction timing for temporal pattern analysis

**Data Display:**
- **Trend Visualizations**: Line charts, bar charts, and heat maps showing spending patterns over time
- **Insight Cards**: Summarized findings with supporting data and confidence indicators
- **Comparison Metrics**: Period-over-period changes with statistical significance indicators

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: Transaction categorization system, budget tracking, and goal management
- **Updates**: Historical pattern analysis and prediction model accuracy scores
- **Creates**: Insight records, recommendation history, and user engagement analytics

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: Smart transaction categorization, budget tracking, savings goal management
**Dependencies**: Requires categorized transaction data and user preference settings
**Impacts**: Influences budget recommendations and goal achievement probability calculations

### Security & Privacy
- **Data Sensitivity**: Spending pattern data considered highly sensitive, encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Anonymization**: Any comparative analysis uses anonymized aggregate data only
- **User Control**: Users can disable pattern analysis and delete insight history at any time

## Acceptance Criteria

### Feature Complete When:
**Core Functionality:**
- [ ] Pattern analysis identifies at least 3 optimization opportunities monthly for users with sufficient data
- [ ] Spending forecasts achieve 85% accuracy for monthly predictions
- [ ] Behavioral insights lead to measurable spending behavior changes (tracked via budget adherence)

**User Experience:**
