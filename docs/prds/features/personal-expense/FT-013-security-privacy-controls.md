# Security & Privacy Controls - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: High

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Users are concerned about connecting bank accounts and storing financial data without comprehensive security measures and privacy controls. Without bank-level security and granular privacy settings, users won't trust the app with sensitive financial information.

### Solution Overview
We're implementing enterprise-grade security infrastructure with granular privacy controls, comprehensive audit logging, and regulatory compliance to ensure user financial data is protected to banking industry standards.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: Achieve zero security incidents and 95% user confidence in data protection measures
**User Success**: Users feel completely secure sharing financial data and have full control over privacy settings

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Security Setup** → User configures privacy preferences → System implements protection measures with clear confirmation
2. **Ongoing Protection** → System monitors and protects continuously → User receives security status updates and alerts
3. **Privacy Management** → User adjusts sharing and storage settings → System respects all privacy choices immediately

**Key User Stories:**
- **As someone connecting bank accounts**, I want bank-level security so that my financial data is protected from breaches and unauthorized access
- **As a privacy-conscious user**, I want control over my data so that I decide what's shared, stored, and how long it's retained

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All financial data encrypted at rest and in transit using AES-256 standards
- **Privacy Control Interface**: Granular settings for data sharing, retention, and feature-specific privacy controls
- **Audit Logging System**: Comprehensive security event tracking with user-accessible audit trails
- **Compliance Framework**: GDPR, CCPA, and financial regulation compliance with regular verification

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection with automated response and user notification
- **Data Export/Deletion**: Complete user data export and secure deletion capabilities
- **Security Dashboard**: User-friendly overview of security status and privacy settings

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Advanced Threat Response**: Focus on prevention and basic detection, not advanced security operations
- **Multi-Tenant Security**: Single-user security model, not enterprise multi-tenant architecture

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Encryption Standards**: All sensitive data uses AES-256 encryption with secure key management
- **Privacy by Default**: Most restrictive privacy settings enabled by default with opt-in for sharing
- **Audit Retention**: Security logs retained for 7 years for compliance, user activity logs for 2 years
- **Data Deletion**: Complete data removal within 30 days of user deletion request with verification

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Security Incident**: When breach detected → **Expected Behavior**: Immediate user notification, affected data identification, and remediation steps
- **Privacy Violation**: When data sharing occurs against user settings → **User Experience**: Immediate correction, user notification, and process improvement

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **Privacy Settings**: Clear, granular controls for each data type and sharing scenario
- **Security Status**: Dashboard showing current protection level and any recommended actions
- **Audit Access**: User-friendly view of security events and data access history
- **Incident Communication**: Clear, non-technical security notifications with actionable guidance

### User Experience Considerations
- **Transparency**: All security measures explained in plain language without technical jargon
- **Control Clarity**: Privacy settings clearly show what each option enables or restricts
- **Trust Building**: Security features visible and understandable to build user confidence
- **Incident Response**: Security events communicated promptly with clear impact assessment

### Accessibility & Usability
- **Settings Accessibility**: All privacy controls work with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Clear Language**: Security information presented in accessible, non-technical terms
- **Visual Security**: Security status uses multiple indicators beyond color for accessibility

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Security Events**: Login attempts, access patterns, system events, and threat indicators
- **Privacy Preferences**: User choices for data sharing, retention, and feature-specific privacy
- **Audit Records**: Complete trail of data access, modifications, and sharing activities
- **Compliance Data**: Documentation required for regulatory compliance and verification

**Data Display:**
- **Security Dashboard**: Current protection status, recent activity, and recommended actions
- **Privacy Settings**: Clear interface showing all privacy choices and their implications
- **Audit Trail**: Searchable history of security events and data access with timestamps
- **Compliance Status**: Regulatory compliance verification and certification display

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: All application features requiring data protection and privacy enforcement
- **Updates**: Security status, privacy settings effectiveness, and compliance metrics
- **Creates**: Security audit records, privacy compliance documentation, and incident reports

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: All features handling sensitive financial data
**Dependencies**: Encryption services, audit logging infrastructure, and compliance frameworks
**Impacts**: Foundational requirement affecting all data handling and feature development

### Security & Privacy
- **Meta-Security**: Security system itself protected with additional layers and monitoring
- **Privacy Enforcement**: Automated enforcement of user privacy choices across all features
- **Compliance Automation**: Continuous monitoring and reporting for regulatory requirements
