# Goal Achievement Analytics - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P2-Medium | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Users struggle to understand why some goals succeed while others fail, and lack insights into how to improve their goal achievement rates. Without analytics on goal performance patterns, users repeat unsuccessful strategies and miss optimization opportunities.

### Solution Overview
We're building an intelligent analytics system that tracks goal achievement patterns, identifies success factors, and provides data-driven recommendations for improving goal completion rates and strategies.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: Users with goal analytics show 35% higher goal completion rates and 50% better goal setting accuracy
**User Success**: Users can predict goal success probability and optimize their approach based on proven success factors

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **User Views Analytics** → System analyzes goal history and patterns → User sees success probability and factor analysis
2. **User Reviews Insights** → System highlights success factors and failure patterns → User gets optimization recommendations
3. **User Applies Learnings** → System tracks behavior changes → User sees improved goal outcomes

**Key User Stories:**
- **As someone with multiple goals**, I want success probability so that I can prioritize effectively and set realistic expectations
- **As someone who wants to improve**, I want achievement analytics so that I can learn from past goals and optimize my approach

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Achievement Probability Modeling**: ML-based prediction of goal success likelihood based on historical patterns
- **Success Factor Analysis**: Identification of behaviors and conditions that correlate with goal achievement
- **Historical Performance Review**: Complete analysis of past goal outcomes with pattern identification
- **Real-time Probability Updates**: Dynamic adjustment of success predictions based on current progress

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Predictive Recommendations**: Specific actions to improve goal success probability
- **Comparative Analysis**: Performance comparison across different goal types and timeframes
- **Success Pattern Templates**: Proven approaches for common goal types based on user success data

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Goal Coaching**: Focus on analytics, not active coaching or behavioral intervention
- **External Benchmark**: Use only user's own historical data, not population comparisons

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Minimum Data**: Require at least 3 completed goals for meaningful probability modeling
- **Success Definition**: Goals marked as completed within 110% of target timeframe considered successful
- **Factor Significance**: Only surface factors with statistical confidence >75% to avoid misleading insights
- **Update Frequency**: Probability scores update weekly but major insights notify only on significant changes

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Insufficient History**: When <3 goals completed → **Expected Behavior**: Show basic progress tracking with future analytics promise
- **Volatile Patterns**: When success factors show high variance → **User Experience**: Explain uncertainty and provide conservative recommendations

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Success probability display with confidence indicators and trend analysis
- **Factor Breakdown**: Visual representation of which behaviors most strongly predict success
- **Historical Review**: Timeline view of past goals with success/failure pattern highlights
- **Recommendation Engine**: Prioritized suggestions with impact estimates and implementation guidance

### User Experience Considerations
- **Confidence Communication**: Clear indication of prediction reliability and data sufficiency
- **Actionable Insights**: Focus on specific, achievable changes rather than general observations
- **Progress Motivation**: Emphasize learning and improvement rather than past failures
- **Complexity Management**: Progressive disclosure from high-level insights to detailed analysis

### Accessibility & Usability
- **Visual Accessibility**: Probability and trend displays use multiple visual cues beyond color
- **Plain Language**: All analytics presented in non-technical terms with clear explanations
- **Mobile Optimization**: Core analytics functionality fully available on mobile devices

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Goal History**: Complete record of all user goals with outcomes, timelines, and final status
- **Progress Patterns**: Regular progress updates and behavioral data during goal pursuit
- **Contextual Data**: External factors like seasonal timing, concurrent goals, and life events
- **Success Metrics**: Achievement rates, completion times, and quality assessments

**Data Display:**
- **Probability Scores**: Numerical success likelihood with confidence ranges and trend indicators
- **Factor Analysis**: Ranked list of success predictors with strength indicators and explanations
- **Historical Charts**: Visual timeline of goal outcomes with pattern highlighting
- **Improvement Tracking**: Progress toward better goal achievement rates over time

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: Savings goal management, spending analysis, and behavioral tracking systems
- **Updates**: Historical goal outcomes and success factor effectiveness tracking
- **Creates**: Achievement predictions, optimization recommendations, and learning insights

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: Savings Goal Management (FT-009), Spending Pattern Analysis (FT-006)
**Dependencies**: Requires completed goal history and behavioral tracking data
**Impacts**: Influences goal setting recommendations and success probability displays

### Security & Privacy
- **Data Protection**: Goal analytics treated as highly personal data with full encryption
- **User Control**: Users can disable analytics tracking and delete all historical analysis
- **Insight Privacy**: No sharing of individual goal patterns or success factors
