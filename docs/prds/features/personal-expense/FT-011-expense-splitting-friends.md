# Expense Splitting with Friends - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P1-High | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Users frequently share expenses with friends and family but lack an integrated way to track, split, and request payment for shared costs. Manual calculation and separate payment apps create friction and often result in incomplete reimbursements.

### Solution Overview
We're building a comprehensive expense splitting system that allows users to share costs with friends, automatically calculate fair splits, and integrate with payment platforms for easy reimbursement tracking.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 60% of users who split expenses report faster reimbursement and 40% increase in expense tracking accuracy
**User Success**: Users can split any expense and get reimbursed without leaving the app or manual calculations

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Expense Selection** ‚Üí User selects expense to split ‚Üí System shows splitting options with friend selection
2. **Split Configuration** ‚Üí User chooses split method and participants ‚Üí System calculates amounts and creates requests
3. **Payment Tracking** ‚Üí System sends requests and tracks responses ‚Üí User sees completion status and reminders

**Key User Stories:**
- **As someone who goes out with friends**, I want expense splitting so that shared costs are divided fairly without manual math
- **As someone who pays for groups**, I want payment requests so that I get reimbursed easily through the app

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Contact Management**: Friend list integration with sharing permissions and contact synchronization
- **Expense Splitting Interface**: Multiple split methods (equal, percentage, custom amounts) with visual allocation
- **Payment Request Generation**: Automated request creation with amount, description, and payment options
- **Split Tracking**: Real-time status tracking for all split expenses and payment completions

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Group Management**: Recurring groups for common friend combinations (roommates, regular dining groups)
- **Payment Integration**: Direct integration with Venmo, PayPal, Zelle for seamless payment processing
- **Split Templates**: Saved splitting patterns for recurring expense types

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Bill Photo Sharing**: Focus on amount splitting, not receipt distribution
- **Debt Consolidation**: Individual expense splits only, not overall balance management

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Split Accuracy**: All splits must total exactly to original expense amount with penny-perfect allocation
- **Payment Validation**: Only confirmed payments update split status; pending requests remain active
- **Friend Privacy**: Users can only split expenses with confirmed friends who have granted permission
- **Request Expiration**: Payment requests automatically expire after 30 days with notification to requester

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Rounding Discrepancies**: When split doesn't divide evenly ‚Üí **Expected Behavior**: Allocate extra cents to expense creator or highest amount participant
- **Payment Platform Failure**: When integrated payment fails ‚Üí **User Experience**: Fallback to manual payment confirmation with receipt upload option

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **Friend Selection**: Multi-select interface with contact photos and recent splitting history
- **Split Calculation**: Visual pie chart or bar display showing each participant's amount and percentage
- **Payment Request**: Clear request summary with payment options and estimated completion time
- **Status Dashboard**: Overview of all active splits with payment status and reminder options

### User Experience Considerations
- **Quick Setup**: Most common splitting scenarios (equal split) completed in under 30 seconds
- **Visual Clarity**: Split amounts clearly displayed with easy adjustment for custom allocations
- **Payment Convenience**: One-tap payment requests with multiple platform options
- **Progress Transparency**: Clear status updates for all participants on payment progress

### Accessibility & Usability
- **Contact Accessibility**: Friend selection works with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Amount Input**: Large, clear input fields for custom split amounts with validation
- **Status Indicators**: Payment status uses both color and text indicators for accessibility

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Friend Relationships**: Contact list integration with splitting permission status
- **Split Configurations**: Participant lists, amounts, percentages, and split method preferences
- **Payment Requests**: Request details, payment platform integration data, and status tracking
- **Split History**: Complete record of all shared expenses with outcomes and timing

**Data Display:**
- **Active Splits**: Current outstanding payment requests with amounts and due dates
- **Split Calculator**: Real-time calculation display showing each participant's share
- **Payment Status**: Progress indicators for each participant with completion timestamps
- **Split History**: Historical view of all shared expenses with search and filtering

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: Manual expense entry, contact management, and payment tracking systems
- **Updates**: Expense records with split status and payment completion data
- **Creates**: Payment requests, friend activity history, and splitting behavior analytics

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: Manual Expense Entry (FT-003), Payment Request systems
**Dependencies**: Contact access permissions and payment platform APIs
**Impacts**: Influences expense categorization and social feature development

### Security & Privacy
- **Contact Privacy**: Friend access requires explicit permission with granular sharing controls
- **Payment Security**: All payment integration uses secure APIs without storing sensitive payment data
- **Split Privacy**: Expense details only visible to participating friends

## Acceptance Criteria

### Feature Complete When:
**Core Functionality:**
- [ ] Expense splitting calculations are mathematically accurate for all split methods
- [ ] Payment requests integrate seamlessly with major payment platforms
- [ ] Split tracking provides real-time status updates for all participants
- [ ] Friend management respects privacy controls and permission settings

**User Experience:**
- [ ] Equal splitting completes in under 30 seconds from expense selection to request sending
