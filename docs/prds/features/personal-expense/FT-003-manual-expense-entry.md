# Manual Expense Entry - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P1-High | **Complexity Estimate**: Low

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Cash transactions and expenses from non-connected accounts create gaps in financial tracking, leading to incomplete spending records and inaccurate budgets. Users need quick, frictionless manual entry for 100% expense capture.

### Solution Overview
Build intuitive manual expense entry with photo receipts, smart defaults, and quick categorization that makes cash expense tracking as easy as automatic bank imports.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: Achieve 100% expense capture vs. 60% baseline, manual entry completion under 30 seconds
**User Success**: Users consistently track cash expenses without friction or forgetting

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Quick Entry** → Tap add expense → Enter amount and category → Add optional details → Save expense
2. **Receipt Capture** → Take photo of receipt → Auto-populate fields when possible → Review and save
3. **Bulk Entry** → Add multiple expenses → Use templates for common expenses → Batch save operations

**Key User Stories:**
- **As someone who uses cash frequently**, I want easy manual entry so that all my expenses are captured accurately
- **As someone who wants records**, I want receipt photos so that I can keep documentation
- **As a busy person**, I want quick entry so that I can log expenses immediately without interrupting my day

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Quick Entry Form**: Streamlined interface for amount, category, description with smart defaults and recent category suggestions
- **Receipt Photo Capture**: Camera integration with photo storage, optional OCR for amount/merchant extraction
- **Location & Time Tagging**: Automatic GPS location capture, timestamp recording, manual override options
- **Offline Capability**: Entry works without internet connection, automatic sync when reconnected

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Voice Notes**: Audio description recording for complex or shared expenses
- **Expense Templates**: Saved templates for frequent manual expenses (parking, tips, cash purchases)
- **Bulk Entry Mode**: Add multiple expenses efficiently with copy/duplicate features

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Advanced OCR**: Full receipt parsing and line-item extraction (future phase)
- **Mileage Tracking**: GPS-based mileage expense calculation (separate feature)

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Data Completeness**: Amount and category required, description and receipt optional but encouraged
- **Timestamp Accuracy**: Default to current time, allow manual adjustment up to 7 days backward
- **Location Privacy**: GPS capture optional, user can disable or manually override location
- **Sync Reliability**: Offline entries sync automatically with conflict resolution for duplicate detection

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: User enters unrealistic amount (e.g., $50,000 coffee) → **Expected Behavior**: Confirmation prompt with option to correct
- **Scenario**: Photo capture fails or receipt is unreadable → **User Experience**: Manual entry fallback with photo storage for reference

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: Enter amount, select category, capture photo, record voice note, save expense
- **System Feedback**: Real-time validation, photo confirmation, sync status, save confirmation
- **Navigation**: Quick access from main screens, floating action button, keyboard shortcuts
- **Visual Requirements**: Clean form design, category icons, photo thumbnails, offline indicators

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: Photo processing takes 2-3 seconds, OCR results appear quickly
- **Empty States**: Helpful prompts for first-time manual entry with tips for accuracy
- **Error States**: Clear validation messages with correction guidance, photo retake options
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Camera optimized for receipts, touch-friendly form controls, gesture support

### Accessibility & Usability
- Screen reader support for all form fields and camera functionality
- Voice input for amount and description fields
- High contrast mode for form visibility and photo review
