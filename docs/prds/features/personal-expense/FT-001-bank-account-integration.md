# Bank Account Integration - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Users abandon expense tracking due to manual data entry burden, leading to incomplete financial records and poor spending awareness. Current manual approaches capture only 60% of expenses and require 5+ minutes per transaction.

### Solution Overview
Build secure, automated bank account integration that imports transactions in real-time, eliminating manual entry while maintaining bank-level security and user control over data access.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 95% of transactions captured automatically vs. 60% manual baseline
**User Success**: Users maintain complete expense records without manual effort

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Connect Bank Account** → User searches for institution → Secure OAuth authentication → Account linking confirmed
2. **Automatic Transaction Import** → Real-time transaction sync → Transactions appear in app → User reviews and categorizes
3. **Account Management** → Monitor connection status → Refresh or disconnect accounts → Troubleshoot sync issues

**Key User Stories:**
- **As a busy professional**, I want automatic expense tracking so that I can see my spending without manual data entry
- **As someone with multiple accounts**, I want all my transactions in one place so that I have complete financial visibility
- **As a security-conscious user**, I want safe bank connections so that my credentials are never stored

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Secure Bank Connectivity**: OAuth 2.0 authentication with read-only access, support for 95% of US financial institutions
- **Real-Time Sync**: Automatic transaction import within 5 minutes of bank posting, duplicate detection and prevention
- **Multi-Account Support**: Connect checking, savings, credit cards from multiple institutions with unified transaction view
- **Connection Management**: Account status monitoring, manual refresh capability, connection troubleshooting guides

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Institution Search**: Smart search with logo recognition and popular bank suggestions
- **Sync History**: Transaction import history with error tracking and resolution
- **Connection Health**: Proactive notifications for connection issues with guided resolution

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Investment Account Integration**: Stock/retirement account connectivity (future phase)
- **International Banks**: Non-US institution support (future phase)

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Security First**: Read-only access only, no credential storage, automatic token refresh
- **Data Accuracy**: Duplicate transaction detection across accounts, consistent transaction formatting
- **Sync Reliability**: Automatic retry on failures, 99.9% transaction capture rate target
- **User Control**: Users can disconnect accounts anytime, immediate data deletion on disconnection

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: Bank connection fails during sync → **Expected Behavior**: Clear error message with reconnection guidance and manual entry fallback
- **Scenario**: Duplicate transactions detected → **User Experience**: Automatic deduplication with user notification and manual override option

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: Search and select bank, authenticate through OAuth, manage connected accounts, refresh connections
- **System Feedback**: Connection status indicators, sync progress displays, error notifications with resolution steps
- **Navigation**: Seamless integration with main app flows, dedicated account management section
- **Visual Requirements**: Bank logos and branding, connection status icons, sync timestamp displays

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: OAuth flow takes 30-60 seconds with progress indicators, sync status visible during updates
- **Empty States**: Helpful guidance for users connecting their first account with security reassurance
- **Error States**: Clear troubleshooting steps for common connection issues with support escalation options
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Touch-friendly bank selection, mobile-optimized OAuth flows, fingerprint authentication support

### Accessibility & Usability
- Screen reader support for bank selection and connection status

- Keyboard navigation for all connection management functions

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Required Inputs**: Bank institution selection, OAuth authorization, account selection preferences
- **Optional Inputs**: Account nicknames, sync frequency preferences, notification settings
- **System Generated**: Connection tokens, sync timestamps, transaction IDs, error logs

**Data Display:**
- **Primary Information**: Account balance, recent transactions, connection status, last sync time
- **Secondary Information**: Account numbers (masked), institution details, sync history
- **Contextual Data**: Transaction import success rates, connection health indicators

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: Transaction records, expense categories, budget calculations, user preferences
- **Updates**: Real-time transaction data, account balances, connection status
- **Creates**: Transaction records, account link records, sync audit trails

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: Financial aggregation services (Plaid/Yodlee), transaction categorization system, security monitoring
**Dependencies**: Financial aggregation service APIs, OAuth providers, security compliance infrastructure
**Impacts**: All expense tracking features depend on reliable transaction data

### Security & Privacy
- **Access Control**: Read-only bank access, encrypted token storage, automatic token expiration
- **Data Sensitivity**: Financial credentials never stored, transaction data encrypted at rest and transit
- **Audit Requirements**: All connection activities logged, security events monitored, compliance reporting
