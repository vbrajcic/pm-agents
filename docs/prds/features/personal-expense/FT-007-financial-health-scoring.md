# Financial Health Scoring - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P2-Medium | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Users struggle to understand their overall financial wellness and lack a clear framework for measuring progress toward financial stability. Without a comprehensive health score, users can't prioritize improvements or track their financial journey effectively.

### Solution Overview
We're building a multi-factor financial health scoring system that provides users with a clear, actionable assessment of their financial wellness, complete with improvement recommendations and progress tracking.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: Users with visible health scores show 25% higher engagement and 30% better goal completion rates
**User Success**: Users can track meaningful financial progress and identify specific actions that improve their overall financial health

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **User Views Health Score** ‚Üí System calculates multi-factor assessment ‚Üí User sees current score with breakdown
2. **User Reviews Components** ‚Üí System explains each factor's impact ‚Üí User understands improvement opportunities
3. **User Takes Action** ‚Üí System tracks behavior changes ‚Üí User sees score improvements over time

**Key User Stories:**
- **As someone wanting financial improvement**, I want a health score so that I can track my overall progress and know where I stand
- **As someone with financial goals**, I want improvement suggestions so that I can increase my score and achieve better financial wellness

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Health Score Calculation**: Multi-factor algorithm considering spending habits, budget adherence, savings rate, and goal progress
- **Component Breakdown**: Detailed factor analysis showing specific contributors to overall score
- **Improvement Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions ranked by impact and feasibility
- **Progress Tracking**: Historical score evolution with milestone celebrations

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Benchmark Comparisons**: Anonymous peer comparison with similar demographics
- **Predictive Modeling**: Score projection based on current trends and planned actions
- **Achievement Badges**: Gamification elements for reaching score milestones

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Credit Score Integration**: Focus on behavioral health, not credit reporting
- **Investment Portfolio Analysis**: Expense and savings focused only

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Score Range**: 0-1000 point scale with clear tier definitions (Poor: 0-300, Fair: 301-500, Good: 501-700, Excellent: 701-1000)
- **Update Frequency**: Score recalculated daily but only shows changes >5 points to avoid noise
- **Factor Weighting**: Spending control (30%), savings rate (25%), goal progress (25%), budget adherence (20%)

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Insufficient Data**: When <14 days of financial data ‚Üí **Expected Behavior**: Show partial score with data collection guidance
- **Score Volatility**: When score changes >50 points in one week ‚Üí **User Experience**: Explain volatility and provide context

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Spending Patterns**: Transaction categorization and spending velocity analysis
- **Budget Performance**: Adherence rates and overspending frequency
- **Savings Behavior**: Savings rate, consistency, and goal contribution patterns
- **Goal Progress**: Achievement rates and timeline adherence across active goals

**Data Display:**
- **Score Visualization**: Large, clear score number with tier indication and trend information
- **Factor Breakdown**: Pie chart or bar chart showing component contributions
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Ranked list with impact estimates and difficulty indicators
- **Historical Progress**: Line chart showing score evolution with annotation for major changes

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: Budget tracking, goal management, spending analysis, and transaction categorization
- **Updates**: Daily score recalculation based on latest financial behavior data
- **Creates**: Score history, improvement tracking, and recommendation effectiveness data

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: Budget tracking, savings goal management, spending pattern analysis
**Dependencies**: Requires functioning budget and goal systems with sufficient historical data
**Impacts**: Influences goal recommendations and budget adjustment suggestions

### Security & Privacy
- **Data Protection**: Health score and component data encrypted and treated as highly sensitive
- **User Control**: Users can disable score tracking and delete all scoring history
- **Benchmark Privacy**: Comparative data uses only anonymized aggregate information
