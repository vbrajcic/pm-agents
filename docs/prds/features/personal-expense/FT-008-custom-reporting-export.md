# Custom Reporting & Export - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P2-Medium | **Complexity Estimate**: Low

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Users need flexible ways to extract and share their financial data for tax preparation, advisor consultations, and personal analysis. Without custom reporting capabilities, users are limited to predefined views and cannot get the specific data they need in usable formats.

### Solution Overview
We're building a flexible report generation system that allows users to create custom financial reports with any date range, category filter, and format combination, plus scheduled delivery for regular reporting needs.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: Users who utilize custom reporting show 40% higher retention and increased premium feature adoption
**User Success**: Users can generate exactly the financial reports they need for any purpose without manual data manipulation

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **User Initiates Report** ‚Üí System opens report builder interface ‚Üí User selects data parameters and format
2. **User Customizes Content** ‚Üí System shows preview with selected data ‚Üí User confirms export settings
3. **User Generates Report** ‚Üí System processes and delivers file ‚Üí User receives formatted report for intended use

**Key User Stories:**
- **As someone doing taxes**, I want custom reports so that I can export exactly the data I need for tax preparation
- **As someone who works with financial advisors**, I want scheduled reports so that I can share regular updates automatically

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Report Builder Interface**: Drag-and-drop interface for selecting date ranges, categories, and data fields
- **Multiple Export Formats**: PDF, CSV, Excel generation with proper formatting for each format
- **Flexible Filtering**: Any combination of date range, category, amount range, and custom tags
- **Template System**: Save and reuse custom report configurations for repeated use

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Scheduled Reports**: Automated generation and delivery on user-defined schedules
- **Sharing Capabilities**: Direct email delivery and secure link sharing for advisors
- **Report Templates**: Pre-built formats for common use cases (taxes, budgeting, business expenses)

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Advanced Analytics**: Focus on data export, not complex analysis within reports
- **Third-party Integration**: Direct export to accounting software (future enhancement)

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Date Range Validation**: Reports can include any historical data but cannot project future transactions
- **Data Privacy**: Users can only export their own transaction data with appropriate privacy controls
- **Format Limitations**: Export size limited to 10,000 transactions per report to ensure performance
- **Retention Policy**: Generated reports stored for 30 days before automatic deletion

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Large Dataset**: When report exceeds 10,000 transactions ‚Üí **Expected Behavior**: Offer date range refinement or multiple smaller reports
- **No Data**: When filter criteria return no results ‚Üí **User Experience**: Clear messaging with filter adjustment suggestions

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **Report Builder**: Visual interface with data field selection, filter controls, and format options
- **Preview Capability**: Sample of report content before full generation to confirm selections
- **Template Gallery**: Library of saved configurations and common report templates
- **Progress Indicators**: Clear feedback during report generation and processing status

### User Experience Considerations
- **Intuitive Filtering**: Visual filter controls that are easy to understand and modify
- **Format Guidance**: Clear explanation of when to use each export format and their advantages
- **Template Efficiency**: Common report types available as one-click templates
- **Error Prevention**: Validation to prevent invalid combinations and empty reports

### Accessibility & Usability
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full report builder functionality accessible via keyboard
- **Screen Reader Support**: All filter controls and options properly labeled for assistive technology
- **Mobile Considerations**: Core functionality available on mobile with simplified interface

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Transaction Data**: All user transactions with complete categorization and metadata
- **Filter Parameters**: User-selected criteria for date ranges, categories, amounts, and tags
- **Format Preferences**: Selected export format and any custom formatting options
- **Template Configurations**: Saved report settings for reuse and scheduling

**Data Display:**
- **Structured Exports**: Properly formatted data with headers, totals, and consistent field ordering
- **Summary Information**: Report metadata including generation date, filter criteria, and row counts
- **Visual Reports**: PDF format includes charts and visual elements for presentation purposes
- **Raw Data**: CSV/Excel formats provide complete transaction detail for further analysis

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: All transaction and categorization data across the application
- **Updates**: Report configurations and template library based on user creation patterns
- **Creates**: Report generation history and usage analytics for feature improvement

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: Transaction categorization, expense tracking, and analytics systems
**Dependencies**: Requires complete transaction database and categorization system
**Impacts**: May influence data storage requirements for efficient report generation

### Security & Privacy
- **Data Security**: All report generation and temporary storage uses encryption
- **Access Control**: Users can only generate reports for their own financial data
- **Secure Sharing**: Shared reports use time-limited secure links with access controls
