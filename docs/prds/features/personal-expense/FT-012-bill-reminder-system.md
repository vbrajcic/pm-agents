# Bill Reminder System - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P1-High | **Complexity Estimate**: Low

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Users struggle to remember bill due dates and often incur late fees, damage their credit, or experience service interruptions due to missed payments. Manual calendar tracking is unreliable and doesn't integrate with spending analysis.

### Solution Overview
We're building an intelligent bill reminder system that tracks recurring bills, sends timely notifications, and integrates with expense tracking to provide comprehensive bill management and payment confirmation.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: Users who enable bill reminders show 50% fewer late payments and 30% better budget adherence
**User Success**: Users never miss a bill due date and can plan payments around their cash flow

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Bill Setup** ‚Üí User adds bill with amount and schedule ‚Üí System calculates due dates and creates reminders
2. **Reminder Delivery** ‚Üí System sends advance notifications ‚Üí User sees upcoming bills and payment options
3. **Payment Confirmation** ‚Üí User marks bill as paid ‚Üí System updates tracking and adjusts future reminders

**Key User Stories:**
- **As someone with many bills**, I want reminders so that I never miss a payment and avoid late fees
- **As someone who wants to avoid fees**, I want advance warnings so that I can plan payments around my cash flow

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Bill Registration**: Easy setup for recurring bills with amount, due date, and frequency
- **Smart Scheduling**: Automatic calculation of future due dates with holiday and weekend adjustments
- **Multi-Channel Notifications**: Push notifications, email alerts, and in-app reminders with customizable timing
- **Payment Confirmation**: Simple interface to mark bills as paid with optional amount verification

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Bill Analytics**: Spending pattern analysis for monthly bill obligations
- **Autopay Integration**: Connection with bank autopay settings for confirmation tracking
- **Bill Variation Tracking**: Detection of amount changes for utility bills and variable payments

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Direct Bill Payment**: Focus on reminders, not payment processing
- **Bill Negotiation**: Payment scheduling only, not bill reduction services

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Due Date Logic**: When due date falls on weekend/holiday, adjust reminder to previous business day
- **Reminder Timing**: Default reminders 7 days, 3 days, and 1 day before due date with user customization
- **Payment Window**: Bills marked as paid remain in current cycle until next due date calculation
- **Late Bill Handling**: Overdue bills get escalated reminder frequency until marked paid

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
