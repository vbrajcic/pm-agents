# Proactive Budget Alerts - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P1-High | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Users discover budget overruns after they happen, when it's too late to course-correct, leading to financial stress and budget abandonment. Reactive awareness creates guilt without providing actionable intervention opportunities.

### Solution Overview
Build intelligent alert system that predicts budget issues before they occur and delivers timely, actionable notifications that help users make better spending decisions in the moment.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: Prevent 70% of budget overruns through proactive intervention vs. reactive discovery
**User Success**: Users feel supported rather than judged, with actionable guidance for staying on track

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Alert Configuration** → Set warning thresholds per category → Choose notification methods → Configure timing preferences
2. **Intelligent Monitoring** → System tracks spending velocity → Predicts budget outcomes → Triggers alerts at optimal times
3. **Actionable Intervention** → Receive timely alerts → See specific recommendations → Take corrective action

**Key User Stories:**
- **As someone who overspends**, I want proactive alerts so that I can make better spending decisions in the moment
- **As someone with strict budgets**, I want customizable thresholds so that I get warnings at the right time for my situation
- **As someone trying to improve**, I want helpful suggestions so that I can learn better financial habits

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Customizable Alert Thresholds**: Per-category warnings at 50%, 75%, 90%, 100% with user customization options
- **Spending Velocity Analysis**: Predict end-of-month outcomes based on current spending patterns and historical data
- **Multi-Channel Delivery**: Push notifications, email alerts, in-app banners with delivery confirmation and user preferences
- **Contextual Recommendations**: Specific suggestions for staying within budget based on spending patterns and remaining time

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Smart Timing**: Deliver alerts when users are most likely to act (e.g., before typical shopping times)
- **Alert Effectiveness Tracking**: Monitor which alerts lead to behavior changes and optimize accordingly

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Spending Blocking**: Prevent transactions or freeze accounts (legal/technical complexity)
- **Social Pressure**: Alerts to family/friends about spending behavior (privacy concerns)

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Alert Frequency**: Maximum one alert per category per day to prevent notification fatigue
- **Escalation Logic**: Progressive alert urgency based on severity and time remaining in budget period
- **Personalization**: Alert thresholds and timing adapt based on user response patterns and effectiveness
- **Opt-Out Respect**: Users can disable alerts by category or entirely without losing other functionality

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: User consistently ignores alerts → **Expected Behavior**: Adjust alert strategy or suggest alternative budget amounts
- **Scenario**: Sudden large expense triggers multiple alerts → **User Experience**: Consolidated alert with comprehensive guidance

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: Configure alert preferences, respond to alerts, snooze notifications, adjust thresholds
- **System Feedback**: Alert delivery confirmation, effectiveness tracking, threshold adjustment suggestions
- **Navigation**: Easy access to alert settings, clear alert history, quick budget adjustment from alerts

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: Alert calculations happen in background, notifications appear immediately
- **Empty States**: Helpful setup guidance for new users with recommended alert configurations
- **Error States**: Clear communication when alerts can't be delivered with alternative notification methods
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Prominent mobile notifications, lock screen visibility, quick action buttons

### Accessibility & Usability
- Screen reader support for all alert content and configuration options
- High contrast mode for alert urgency levels and call-to-action buttons
- Vibration and sound patterns for different alert severities
