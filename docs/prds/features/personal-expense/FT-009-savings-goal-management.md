# Savings Goal Management - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
People struggle to save money because goals feel abstract and progress is invisible, leading to 70% savings goal abandonment. Without clear tracking and motivation, users prioritize immediate spending over future financial security.

### Solution Overview
Build goal-driven savings tracking with visual progress, automated suggestions, and achievement milestones that transform abstract goals into concrete, motivating progress.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 70% goal achievement rate vs. 30% traditional approaches, 40% increase in user savings rate
**User Success**: Users consistently save toward goals and celebrate meaningful financial milestones

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Goal Creation** → Define goal type and target → Set timeline and amount → Configure tracking preferences
2. **Progress Tracking** → Automatic progress calculation → Visual milestone celebration → Savings opportunity identification
3. **Goal Achievement** → Milestone notifications → Success celebration → Next goal suggestion

**Key User Stories:**
- **As someone saving for vacation**, I want goal tracking so that I can see my progress and stay motivated
- **As someone who struggles to save**, I want automated suggestions so that I can find money for my goals
- **As someone with multiple goals**, I want prioritization help so that I can allocate money effectively

### Functional Requirements
