# Reporting & Analytics Dashboard - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P1 | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
The company needs comprehensive reporting capabilities to maintain accurate financial records, demonstrate compliance, and make data-driven decisions about equipment and software investments. Without proper analytics and export capabilities, the accounting team cannot efficiently process reports and administrators cannot optimize resource allocation.

### Solution Overview
A comprehensive reporting and analytics dashboard that provides equipment inventory reports, financial summaries, request analytics, role-based dashboard views, and multi-format data export capabilities to support accounting, compliance, and strategic decision-making needs.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 100% accurate reporting for accounting and compliance with data-driven insights for optimization
**User Success**: Users can generate needed reports quickly and export data in preferred formats without technical assistance

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Report Access** → User selects report type → System applies role-based filters → Report generated with current data
2. **Data Analysis** → User views interactive dashboard → Filters applied for specific insights → Key metrics highlighted
3. **Data Export** → User selects export format → System processes data → Download provided in requested format

**Key User Stories:**
- **As an accounting team member**, I want to export equipment reports in standard formats so I can maintain accurate financial records and meet audit requirements
- **As an admin**, I want to see comprehensive system analytics so I can make data-driven decisions about equipment procurement and budget allocation
- **As a manager**, I want to view team-specific reports so I can track team assets and optimize resource utilization

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- Equipment inventory reports with comprehensive asset reporting and filtering options
- Financial summary reports with cost analysis, budget tracking, and subscription expenses
- Request analytics dashboard showing workflow performance and bottleneck analysis
- Data export system supporting multiple formats (CSV, PDF, Excel) for accounting needs
- Role-based dashboard views with customized metrics and information per user role
- Real-time data accuracy ensuring reports reflect current system state

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- Report scheduling and automated delivery via email
- Custom report builder for ad-hoc analysis needs
- Historical trend analysis and comparative reporting
- Dashboard customization allowing users to configure preferred metrics

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- Advanced business intelligence features beyond basic analytics
- Integration with external analytics platforms
- Complex statistical analysis or predictive modeling

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- All reports must be exportable in standard formats for accounting compatibility
- Role-based report access controls ensure users only see appropriate data
- Real-time data accuracy requirements prevent stale or inconsistent reporting
- Financial data aggregation must be precise to 2 decimal places for accounting standards

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: Large report generation exceeds processing time → **Expected Behavior**: Progress indicator shown, report delivered via email when complete
- **Scenario**: Export format requested with incompatible data → **User Experience**: Clear format limitation explanation with alternative export options

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: Select report types, apply filters, configure date ranges, export data, customize dashboards
- **System Feedback**: Report generation progress, export completion notifications, data freshness indicators
- **Navigation**: Report library, dashboard views, export history, analytics insights
- **Visual Requirements**: Interactive charts and graphs, data visualization, clear metric displays, export format options

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: Report generation progress bars, large export processing indicators
- **Empty States**: New system with minimal data, filtered reports with no results, historical periods with no activity
- **Error States**: Export failures, data processing errors, filter combination with no results
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Report viewing and basic export functionality on mobile devices

### Accessibility & Usability
- High contrast charts and data visualizations for accessibility
- Keyboard navigation for all reporting interfaces and export functions
- Screen reader compatible table data and chart information

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Required Inputs**: Date ranges, filter criteria, export format selection, dashboard configuration preferences
- **Optional Inputs**: Custom report parameters, scheduled delivery preferences, comparative periods
- **System Generated**: Report IDs, generation timestamps, export files, analytics calculations

**Data Display:**
- **Primary Information**: Key metrics, current totals, trend indicators displayed prominently on dashboards
- **Secondary Information**: Detailed breakdowns, historical comparisons, drill-down data available on request
- **Contextual Data**: Role-appropriate metrics, team-specific data, permission-filtered information

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: All system entities (users, equipment, subscriptions, requests) for comprehensive reporting
- **Updates**: Analytics calculations, report caches, dashboard configurations
- **Creates**: Report files, export downloads, analytics snapshots, scheduled deliveries

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: All system features for data aggregation, user authentication for role-based access
**Dependencies**: Data from equipment, subscription, and request systems, file storage for exports
**Impacts**: System performance during large report generation, storage requirements for export files

### Security & Privacy
- **Access Control**: Role-based report access with data filtering appropriate to user permissions
- **Data Sensitivity**: Financial information restricted to appropriate roles, personal data protected in exports
- **Audit Requirements**: Report generation, export activities, and data access logged for compliance
