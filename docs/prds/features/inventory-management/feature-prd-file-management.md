# File Management & Invoice Storage - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P2 | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

🚨 **MISSING INFO ALERTS** (Remove when resolved):
- [ ] File storage capacity limits and retention policies
- [ ] Security encryption requirements for sensitive financial documents
- [ ] Integration with accounting system file import requirements

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Employees need to upload and store invoices for software subscriptions and equipment purchases, but the company lacks a secure, organized system for financial document management. Without proper file storage, accounting teams cannot efficiently process reimbursements and maintain compliance with financial record-keeping requirements.

### Solution Overview
A secure file management system that handles invoice uploads, document categorization, version control, and role-based access for sensitive financial documents, supporting accounting workflows and compliance requirements.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 100% secure document storage with organized access for accounting and compliance purposes
**User Success**: Employees can easily upload invoices and accounting teams can efficiently access needed financial documents

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **File Upload** → User selects invoice file → System validates format and security → File uploaded with categorization
2. **Document Organization** → File automatically categorized → Metadata added → Searchable document library updated
3. **Access & Retrieval** → Authorized users search documents → Files retrieved with proper permissions → Download or preview available

**Key User Stories:**
- **As an employee**, I want to upload invoices for my subscriptions so accounting can process reimbursements and maintain financial records
- **As an accounting team member**, I want secure access to all invoices so I can maintain financial records and process reimbursements efficiently
- **As an admin**, I want organized document storage with proper access controls so sensitive financial information remains secure

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- Secure file upload system supporting multiple formats (PDF, images, documents) with validation
- File categorization system with tagging and organization capabilities for efficient retrieval
- Role-based file access control ensuring sensitive documents reach only authorized personnel
- File versioning system for handling updated documents and maintaining document history
- File search and retrieval with metadata-based finding capabilities
- Secure file storage with encryption and backup for compliance requirements

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- Drag-and-drop file upload interface for improved user experience
- File preview functionality for common document types
- Bulk file upload for efficient document migration
- File compression and optimization for storage efficiency

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- Advanced document editing or annotation features
- Optical character recognition (OCR) for searchable text extraction
- Integration with external document management systems

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- Invoice files must be securely stored with appropriate encryption for financial compliance
- File categorization required for efficient organization and accounting workflow
- Version control essential for updated invoices while maintaining audit trail
- Access controls must prevent unauthorized viewing of sensitive financial documents

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: File upload exceeds size limit → **Expected Behavior**: Clear error message with size limit explanation and file compression guidance
- **Scenario**: Sensitive document accessed by unauthorized user → **User Experience**: Access denied message with explanation of permission requirements

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: Upload files, categorize documents, search files, download/preview, manage versions
- **System Feedback**: Upload progress indicators, file processing status, access confirmations, search results
- **Navigation**: File library, upload interface, search results, document categories
- **Visual Requirements**: File type icons, upload progress bars, categorization labels, permission indicators

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: File upload progress, document processing, search result loading
- **Empty States**: New user with no uploaded files, search with no results, category with no documents
- **Error States**: Upload failures, access denied scenarios, file format rejections
- **Mobile/Responsive**: File upload and basic management functionality on mobile devices

### Accessibility & Usability
- Keyboard accessible file upload and management interfaces
- Screen reader compatible file information and categorization
- High contrast indicators for file types and access permissions

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Required Inputs**: File content, file type, category assignment, associated subscription/equipment
- **Optional Inputs**: File description, tags, expiration date, custom metadata
- **System Generated**: File ID, upload timestamp, version numbers, access logs

**Data Display:**
- **Primary Information**: File name, type, upload date, category displayed in file listings
- **Secondary Information**: File size, version history, access permissions on detail view
- **Contextual Data**: Related subscriptions/equipment, user access history, download statistics

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: Software subscriptions, equipment records, user accounts, reimbursement requests
- **Updates**: File metadata, version information, access permissions, category assignments
- **Creates**: File records, version entries, access logs, search indexes

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: Software Subscription Management (FT-003) for invoice association, User Authentication (FT-001) for access control
**Dependencies**: Cloud storage infrastructure, file encryption services, backup systems
**Impacts**: Subscription cost tracking, reimbursement workflows, compliance reporting

### Security & Privacy
- **Access Control**: Role-based file permissions with financial document protection
- **Data Sensitivity**: Invoice encryption, secure file transmission, access audit trails
- **Audit Requirements**: File uploads, downloads, access attempts, and permission changes logged

## Acceptance Criteria
