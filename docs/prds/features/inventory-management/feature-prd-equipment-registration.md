# Equipment Registration & Management - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0 | **Complexity Estimate**: High

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Employees need a comprehensive system to register, track, and manage all company equipment throughout its lifecycle. Without proper equipment management, the company cannot maintain accurate asset records, track equipment transfers, or ensure accountability for valuable resources.

### Solution Overview
A complete equipment registration and management system that captures all device information, manages ownership transfers, tracks equipment status, integrates QR code scanning, and provides full lifecycle visibility from purchase through disposal.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 100% equipment visibility with accurate ownership tracking and transfer audit trails
**User Success**: Users can easily register equipment, transfer ownership, and access complete equipment information

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Equipment Registration** ‚Üí User enters device details ‚Üí System generates unique record and QR code ‚Üí Equipment ready for use
2. **Equipment Transfer** ‚Üí User initiates transfer ‚Üí System routes for approval ‚Üí Transfer completed with audit trail
3. **Equipment Status Updates** ‚Üí User updates equipment condition ‚Üí System records changes ‚Üí Status history maintained

**Key User Stories:**
- **As an employee**, I want to register my assigned equipment so the company has accurate asset records and I can prove ownership
- **As a manager**, I want to see all equipment assigned to my team members so I can track team assets and plan replacements
- **As an admin**, I want to track equipment from purchase through disposal so I can manage the complete asset lifecycle and maintain compliance

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- Equipment registration with comprehensive metadata (serial numbers, model, purchase info, specifications)
- Equipment transfer system with approval workflow and complete audit trail
- Equipment status management (Active, In Repair, Decommissioned, etc.) with status history
- QR code generation for each piece of equipment for quick identification
- Equipment search and filtering across all fields with performance optimization
- Equipment lifecycle tracking including depreciation and maintenance history

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- Bulk equipment import for initial system setup
- Equipment categories with custom fields for different device types
- Maintenance scheduling and reminder system
- Equipment location tracking
- Photo upload for equipment visual identification

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- Physical asset tag printing and management
- Automatic depreciation calculation (manual entry only)
- Integration with procurement systems for automatic equipment addition

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- All equipment must have unique serial numbers within the system
- Equipment transfers require approval and create immutable audit trail
- Equipment status must always reflect current physical state and condition
- Only current equipment owner can initiate transfers (except for admin override)

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: Equipment with duplicate serial number entered ‚Üí **Expected Behavior**: System rejects entry with clear error message and suggests checking existing records
- **Scenario**: Transfer request for equipment already in pending transfer ‚Üí **User Experience**: Clear notification that equipment is unavailable for transfer with current status

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: Register equipment, edit equipment details, initiate transfers, update status, scan QR codes
- **System Feedback**: Registration confirmations, transfer status updates, QR code display, search results
- **Navigation**: Equipment dashboard, personal equipment list, team equipment views (role-based)
- **Visual Requirements**: Equipment cards with key info, status indicators, QR codes, transfer history visualization

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: Equipment registration progress, transfer processing, search result loading
- **Empty States**: New user with no equipment, team with no assigned equipment, search with no results
- **Error States**: Registration failures, QR code scan errors, transfer rejection notifications
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Full equipment management functionality on mobile devices with optimized forms

### Accessibility & Usability
- High contrast QR codes for reliable scanning
- Keyboard accessible equipment forms and search
- Screen reader compatible equipment information display

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Required Inputs**: Equipment type, brand, model, serial number, current owner
- **Optional Inputs**: Purchase date, purchase price, specifications, description, photos
- **System Generated**: Equipment ID, QR code, registration timestamp, status history

**Data Display:**
- **Primary Information**: Equipment type, model, current owner, status displayed prominently
- **Secondary Information**: Serial number, purchase info, specifications available on detail view
- **Contextual Data**: Transfer history, maintenance records, depreciation status

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: User accounts (ownership), transfer records, maintenance history
- **Updates**: Equipment status, ownership, specifications, location
- **Creates**: Equipment records, QR codes, transfer requests, status change events

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: User authentication (ownership), QR scanning system, approval workflows
**Dependencies**: QR code generation service, camera integration for scanning
**Impacts**: Request workflows (equipment availability), reporting (asset tracking)

### Security & Privacy
- **Access Control**: Users see their equipment plus team equipment (role-based)
- **Data Sensitivity**: Financial information (purchase prices) restricted to admins
- **Audit Requirements**: All equipment changes, transfers, and access events logged

## Acceptance Criteria

### Feature Complete When:
**Core Functionality:**
- [ ] Users can register equipment with all required metadata and validation
- [ ] Equipment transfers work end-to-end with approval and audit trail
- [ ] QR code generation and scanning successfully identifies equipment
