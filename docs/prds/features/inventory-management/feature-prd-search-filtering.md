# Advanced Search & Filtering System - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P2 | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

🚨 **MISSING INFO ALERTS** (Remove when resolved):
- [ ] Search indexing strategy for large datasets and performance optimization
- [ ] Saved search complexity and user customization requirements
- [ ] Export functionality integration with search results

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Users need to quickly find specific equipment, subscriptions, and requests within potentially large datasets, but basic search capabilities are insufficient for complex queries and detailed filtering needs. Without advanced search, users waste time manually browsing through lists and cannot efficiently generate targeted reports.

### Solution Overview
A comprehensive search and filtering system providing full-text search across all data types, combinable multi-criteria filters, saved search functionality, and performance optimization to handle large datasets efficiently while maintaining sub-second response times.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 90% reduction in time spent finding specific items with search accuracy >95%
**User Success**: Users can quickly locate any equipment, subscription, or request using intuitive search and filtering tools

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Search Initiation** → User enters search terms or accesses filters → System processes query across all relevant data → Results displayed instantly
2. **Filter Refinement** → User applies additional filters → Results updated in real-time → Targeted dataset achieved
3. **Result Action** → User selects items from results → Actions available based on permissions → Operations completed efficiently

**Key User Stories:**
- **As a user**, I want to quickly find specific equipment using any available information so I can access relevant details without browsing through long lists
- **As an admin**, I want to filter data across multiple criteria so I can generate targeted reports and manage specific subsets of equipment or subscriptions
- **As a manager**, I want to save frequently used searches so I can quickly access team-specific information without reconfiguring filters

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- Universal search engine with full-text search across all entities (equipment, subscriptions, users, requests)
- Advanced filter interface supporting multi-criteria filtering with combinable conditions
- Search performance optimization with database indexing and efficient query handling
- Saved search functionality allowing users to store and reuse complex filter combinations
- Search result export capabilities enabling data extraction in multiple formats
- Real-time search suggestions and auto-complete for improved user experience

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- Search analytics providing insights into popular searches and optimization opportunities
- Global search shortcuts accessible from any system page
- Search result sorting and custom column selection for flexible data presentation
- Search history allowing users to revisit recent searches

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- Advanced semantic search or natural language processing
- Integration with external search engines or platforms
- Complex machine learning-based search ranking algorithms

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- Search must work across all data types with consistent interface and behavior
- Filters must be combinable for complex queries without performance degradation
- Search performance must remain sub-second even with large datasets (1000+ items)
- Saved searches must respect user permissions and show only accessible data

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: Search query returns no results → **Expected Behavior**: Clear "no results" message with search suggestion or filter adjustment tips
- **Scenario**: Complex filter combination causes performance issues → **User Experience**: Progressive loading with option to simplify query for better performance

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: Enter search terms, apply filters, save searches, export results, sort columns, select items for actions
- **System Feedback**: Search progress indicators, result counts, filter active states, export confirmations
- **Navigation**: Global search bar, advanced filter panel, saved searches menu, search result actions
- **Visual Requirements**: Search result cards/tables, filter tags, saved search indicators, performance feedback

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: Search processing indicators, large result set loading, export generation progress
- **Empty States**: No search results, no saved searches, new user with no search history
- **Error States**: Search failures, filter validation errors, export generation failures
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Optimized search interface for mobile with essential filtering options

### Accessibility & Usability
- Keyboard navigation for all search and filter controls
- Screen reader compatible search results and filter status announcements
- High contrast search result highlighting and filter state indicators

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Required Inputs**: Search terms, filter criteria, sorting preferences, export format selection
- **Optional Inputs**: Saved search names, search descriptions, custom column selections
- **System Generated**: Search IDs, query timestamps, result statistics, performance metrics

**Data Display:**
- **Primary Information**: Search results with key item details, relevance indicators, match highlighting
- **Secondary Information**: Detailed item information, related data, action options
- **Contextual Data**: Search result counts, filter summaries, performance indicators

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: All system entities for comprehensive search coverage
- **Updates**: Search indexes, user search preferences, saved search configurations
- **Creates**: Search result sets, export files, search history entries, analytics data

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: All data features (Equipment, Subscriptions, Requests) for search content, User Authentication for permissions
**Dependencies**: Database optimization, search indexing service, export functionality
**Impacts**: System performance during large queries, user workflow efficiency, data accessibility

### Security & Privacy
- **Access Control**: Search results filtered by user permissions, saved searches respect role-based access
- **Data Sensitivity**: Search queries logged appropriately, sensitive data protected in results
- **Audit Requirements**: Search activities, export actions, and data access patterns logged
