# User Authentication & Role Management - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0 | **Complexity Estimate**: High

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
The inventory management system requires secure access control to protect company assets and ensure users only access appropriate data based on their organizational role. Without proper authentication and role management, the system cannot maintain data security or support the hierarchical approval workflows needed for equipment management.

### Solution Overview
A comprehensive user authentication and role-based access control system that manages three user types (Employee, Team Lead, Admin) with hierarchical permissions, team relationships, and secure session management.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 100% of system access properly authenticated with zero unauthorized data access incidents
**User Success**: Users can access their role-appropriate functionality without confusion or access barriers

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **User Login** ‚Üí System validates credentials ‚Üí User redirected to role-appropriate dashboard
2. **Role-Based Navigation** ‚Üí System shows only permitted features ‚Üí User sees relevant functionality
3. **Team Hierarchy Access** ‚Üí User requests team data ‚Üí System validates hierarchy permissions ‚Üí User accesses appropriate team information

**Key User Stories:**
- **As an admin**, I want to invite users and assign roles so I can control system access and maintain security
- **As a team lead**, I want to see my team's equipment and requests so I can manage team resources effectively
- **As an employee**, I want to access only my equipment and requests so my data stays private and the interface stays focused

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- User registration through email invitation system with role assignment
- Three-tier role hierarchy: Employee ‚Üí Team Lead ‚Üí Admin with inheritance
- Team hierarchy management allowing team leads to manage direct reports
- Session management with secure authentication and automatic timeout
- Password policies and account security measures
- User profile management with role and team assignment

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- Single sign-on (SSO) integration capability
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) option
- User activity monitoring and login history
- Bulk user invitation and management tools

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- External identity provider integration beyond basic SSO preparation
- Complex organizational chart management beyond direct reporting
- Advanced user provisioning workflows

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- Team hierarchy determines data visibility: Team leads see their direct reports' data, Admins see all data
- Role changes require admin approval and create audit trail
- Deactivated users retain historical data association but lose all system access
- User invitations expire after 7 days and must be resent

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: User account deactivated while logged in ‚Üí **Expected Behavior**: Session immediately terminated, user logged out
- **Scenario**: Team lead transferred to different team ‚Üí **User Experience**: Previous team access revoked, new team access granted automatically

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: Login/logout, password reset, profile editing, team member invitation (for appropriate roles)
- **System Feedback**: Clear authentication status, role-based menu visibility, permission denied messages
- **Navigation**: Role-appropriate sidebar navigation, contextual permissions throughout application
- **Visual Requirements**: Clear role indicators, team hierarchy visualization for team leads and admins

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: Authentication progress indicators, profile save confirmations
- **Empty States**: New user onboarding flow, team leads with no direct reports
- **Error States**: Clear authentication failure messages, permission denied explanations with next steps
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Full authentication functionality on mobile devices

### Accessibility & Usability
- Keyboard navigation for all authentication forms
- Screen reader compatible role and permission indicators
- High contrast authentication interfaces

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Required Inputs**: Email, password, full name, role assignment, team assignment
- **Optional Inputs**: Phone number, job title, department
- **System Generated**: User ID, creation timestamp, last login, session tokens

**Data Display:**
- **Primary Information**: User name, role, team membership displayed in header/profile
- **Secondary Information**: User activity history, team member lists (for team leads/admins)
- **Contextual Data**: Permission-appropriate navigation and feature access

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: All system entities through user ownership and permissions
- **Updates**: User profiles, team assignments, role changes
- **Creates**: User accounts, team relationships, authentication sessions

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: All system features requiring user authentication and authorization
**Dependencies**: Email service for invitations, secure session storage
**Impacts**: Every feature in the system relies on user authentication state

### Security & Privacy
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions with least-privilege principle
- **Data Sensitivity**: Password encryption, secure session management, PII protection
- **Audit Requirements**: All authentication events, role changes, and permission modifications logged

## Acceptance Criteria

### Feature Complete When:
**Core Functionality:**
- [ ] Users can register through email invitation and set initial passwords
- [ ] Three-tier role system (Employee/Team Lead/Admin) enforces appropriate permissions
- [ ] Team hierarchy allows team leads to manage direct reports and associated data
- [ ] Session management handles login, logout, and automatic timeout securely

**User Experience:**
- [ ] Role-appropriate navigation and feature visibility work correctly
- [ ] Permission denied scenarios provide clear guidance to users
- [ ] User profile management allows appropriate self-service capabilities

**Quality Standards:**
- [ ] All authentication attempts logged for security monitoring
- [ ] Password policies enforced with secure storage
- [ ] Role-based access control prevents unauthorized data access

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: User receives invitation, creates account, logs in, sees role-appropriate dashboard
2. **Error Handling**: Invalid credentials, expired sessions, permission boundaries all handled gracefully
3. **Edge Cases**: Concurrent logins, role changes during active sessions, team transfers
4. **Integration**: Authentication state properly shared across all system features

### Detailed User Flows

**Primary Flow - User Onboarding:**
1. **Entry Point**: Admin sends email invitation with role assignment
   - User context: New team member needs system access
   - Pre-conditions: Admin has team member's email and role decision

2. **Account Creation**: User follows invitation link and creates account
   - User action ‚Üí Email validation ‚Üí User sets password and profile info
   - Password policy enforcement and confirmation
   - Team assignment automatically applied from invitation

3. **First Login**: User accesses system with new credentials
   - Information displayed: Welcome message, role explanation, available features
   - Available actions: Profile completion, password change, system exploration
   - Exit points: Role-appropriate dashboard with contextual onboarding

**Alternative Flows:**
- **Password Reset Flow**: Forgot password request ‚Üí Email verification ‚Üí Password reset ‚Üí Login confirmation
- **Role Change Flow**: Admin modifies user role ‚Üí User notified ‚Üí Next login shows updated permissions
- **Team Transfer Flow**: User moved between teams ‚Üí Previous team access revoked ‚Üí New team access granted

## Dependencies & Constraints

### Prerequisites
- **Feature Dependencies**: Database infrastructure, email service configuration
- **Data Dependencies**: User and team data models, role permission structure
- **External Dependencies**: Email service provider, secure session storage solution

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: Authentication within 2 seconds, role permission checks sub-second
- **Scale Requirements**: Support 300+ concurrent users, 1000+ total system users
- **Device/Browser Support**: Modern browsers, mobile responsive authentication
