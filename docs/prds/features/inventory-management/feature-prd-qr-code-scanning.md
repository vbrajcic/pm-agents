# Mobile QR Code Scanning System - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P1 | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

🚨 **MISSING INFO ALERTS** (Remove when resolved):
- [ ] QR code format specification and encoding requirements
- [ ] Mobile browser compatibility requirements across device types
- [ ] Offline scanning data storage capacity and sync behavior

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Field users need a quick and reliable way to identify equipment for updates, transfers, and status changes. Manual equipment identification is time-consuming and error-prone, especially when dealing with similar devices or when serial numbers are not easily visible.

### Solution Overview
A mobile-optimized QR code scanning system that allows users to quickly identify equipment using their device cameras, with fallback manual entry options and offline capability for field use where internet connectivity may be limited.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 95%+ equipment identification accuracy with 50% reduction in time spent on equipment lookup
**User Success**: Users can quickly identify any equipment piece using mobile device without manual serial number entry

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Scan Initiation** → User accesses camera scanner → Camera activates with scanning interface → QR code detection begins
2. **Equipment Identification** → QR code scanned successfully → System looks up equipment → Equipment details displayed immediately
3. **Action Selection** → Equipment confirmed → User selects desired action → Action completed with equipment context

**Key User Stories:**
- **As a field user**, I want to scan QR codes to quickly identify equipment so I can update records efficiently without typing serial numbers
- **As an admin**, I want QR code scanning to work reliably across devices so equipment tracking remains accurate and user-friendly
- **As an employee**, I want fallback manual entry when scanning fails so I'm never blocked from completing equipment tasks

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- QR code generation system creating unique codes for all equipment during registration
- Mobile camera integration with browser-based scanning (no app installation required)
- QR code validation system with equipment lookup and verification
- Mobile-optimized interface with touch-friendly scanning controls
- Fallback manual entry option when QR scanning fails or is unavailable
- Offline scanning capability with local storage and sync when connection restored

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- Barcode support for equipment that may have traditional barcodes
- Bulk scanning mode for processing multiple equipment items
- Scanning history for audit trail and troubleshooting
- Camera permission handling with clear user guidance

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- Native mobile app development (web-based only)
- Advanced image processing for damaged or low-quality codes
- Integration with external barcode/QR systems beyond equipment database

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- QR codes must uniquely identify equipment within the system
- Scanning must work reliably on mobile devices without app installation
- Fallback manual entry required when scanning technology fails
- Offline scanned data must sync accurately when connectivity restored

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: Camera permission denied by user → **Expected Behavior**: Clear explanation shown with fallback to manual entry option
- **Scenario**: QR code damaged or unreadable → **User Experience**: Scan failure message with manual entry prompt and equipment lookup assistance

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: Activate camera, scan QR codes, confirm equipment identity, select follow-up actions, manual entry fallback
- **System Feedback**: Camera status indicators, scan success/failure notifications, equipment identification confirmations
- **Navigation**: Scanning interface from equipment context, equipment details post-scan, action selection menus
- **Visual Requirements**: Camera viewfinder with scan area indicator, equipment details cards, clear action buttons

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: Camera activation, QR code processing, equipment lookup, offline sync status
- **Empty States**: No camera access, no equipment found for scanned code, offline mode with no cached data
- **Error States**: Camera permission issues, scan failures, equipment lookup errors, connectivity problems
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Touch-optimized interface, device orientation handling, various screen sizes

### Accessibility & Usability
- High contrast scan area indicators for clear targeting
- Vibration feedback for successful scans (where supported)
- Voice guidance option for users with visual impairments
- Manual entry always available as accessibility alternative

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Required Inputs**: QR code data, equipment lookup verification, user confirmation of correct equipment
- **Optional Inputs**: Scan location metadata, timestamp, follow-up action selections
- **System Generated**: Scan events, equipment access logs, offline sync queue

**Data Display:**
- **Primary Information**: Equipment name, current owner, status displayed immediately after scan
- **Secondary Information**: Full equipment details, recent activity, available actions
- **Contextual Data**: User's relationship to equipment, permitted actions, equipment history

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: Equipment database for identification, user permissions for actions, activity logs
- **Updates**: Equipment access records, user activity history, offline sync status
- **Creates**: Scan events, equipment interaction logs, offline data queue

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: Equipment Registration & Management (FT-002) for equipment data, User Authentication (FT-001) for permissions
**Dependencies**: Equipment database with QR codes, mobile browser camera APIs, offline storage capability
**Impacts**: Equipment activity tracking, user workflow efficiency, data accuracy

### Security & Privacy
- **Access Control**: Camera permission handling, equipment visibility based on user permissions
- **Data Sensitivity**: Equipment access patterns, location metadata privacy
- **Audit Requirements**: Equipment scans logged with user, timestamp, and actions taken
