# Audit Trail & Compliance System - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P1 | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

🚨 **MISSING INFO ALERTS** (Remove when resolved):
- [ ] Specific compliance requirements and regulatory standards to meet
- [ ] Audit log retention periods and archival storage requirements
- [ ] Immutable storage implementation and tamper-proof verification methods

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
The company needs comprehensive audit trails and compliance capabilities to demonstrate regulatory compliance, investigate issues, and maintain accountability for all system changes. Without proper audit logging, the company cannot meet compliance requirements or effectively troubleshoot system issues.

### Solution Overview
A comprehensive audit trail and compliance system that logs all critical operations, provides immutable audit storage, offers user-friendly audit trail visualization, generates compliance reports, and includes audit search and analysis tools for investigation and compliance demonstration.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 100% compliance readiness with complete audit trails for all critical operations and regulatory requirements
**User Success**: Compliance officers and admins can easily generate audit reports and investigate system activities

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Automatic Logging** → System operations occur → Audit events captured automatically → Immutable storage secured
2. **Compliance Reporting** → User requests compliance report → System generates comprehensive audit report → Report delivered in required format
3. **Audit Investigation** → User searches audit trail → System provides detailed activity history → Issue investigation completed

**Key User Stories:**
- **As a compliance officer**, I want complete audit trails so I can demonstrate regulatory compliance and meet audit requirements
- **As an admin**, I want to track all system changes so I can investigate issues and maintain accountability for critical operations
- **As a security officer**, I want immutable audit logs so I can ensure data integrity and prevent tampering with compliance records

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- Comprehensive audit logging capturing all CRUD operations, user actions, and system changes
- Immutable audit storage ensuring tamper-proof log preservation and data integrity
- Audit trail visualization providing user-friendly interface for reviewing system activity
- Compliance reporting with pre-built reports for common regulatory requirements
- Log retention management with automated archiving and compliance-appropriate storage periods
- Audit search and analysis tools enabling efficient investigation and data discovery

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- Real-time audit monitoring with alerts for suspicious activities
- Audit data export capabilities for external compliance systems
- Custom audit report builder for specific compliance requirements
- Audit performance analytics and system health monitoring

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- Integration with external SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems
- Advanced threat detection or security analytics beyond basic monitoring
- Automated compliance violation detection and alerting

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- All critical operations must be logged with complete context and user attribution
- Audit logs must be immutable and tamper-proof for compliance integrity
- Log retention must meet compliance periods with secure archival for long-term storage
- Audit access must be role-based with appropriate security controls and activity logging

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: Audit logging system fails during critical operation → **Expected Behavior**: Operation blocked until logging restored or emergency override with enhanced logging post-recovery
- **Scenario**: Immutable storage integrity check fails → **User Experience**: Alert generated for security team with affected record isolation and investigation workflow

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: Search audit logs, generate compliance reports, review activity timelines, export audit data
- **System Feedback**: Search result summaries, report generation progress, export confirmations, integrity status indicators
- **Navigation**: Audit search interface, compliance dashboard, activity timelines, report library
- **Visual Requirements**: Timeline visualizations, activity summaries, compliance status indicators, search result highlighting

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: Audit search processing, large report generation, data export preparation
- **Empty States**: New system with minimal audit data, search queries with no results, compliance periods with no activity
- **Error States**: Search failures, report generation errors, integrity check failures
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Essential audit review functionality on mobile devices with optimized interfaces

### Accessibility & Usability
- High contrast timeline visualizations and audit trail displays
- Keyboard navigation for all audit search and reporting interfaces
- Screen reader compatible audit information and compliance status

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Required Inputs**: All system operations, user actions, data changes, access events for comprehensive logging
- **Optional Inputs**: Custom audit tags, investigation notes, compliance annotations
- **System Generated**: Audit IDs, timestamps, user attribution, operation context, integrity checksums

**Data Display:**
- **Primary Information**: Audit event summaries, user actions, timestamps displayed in chronological order
- **Secondary Information**: Detailed operation context, data changes, system impact on drill-down
- **Contextual Data**: Related events, user sessions, compliance relevance, investigation status

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: All system entities for comprehensive audit coverage and activity tracking
- **Updates**: Audit indexes, compliance status, retention metadata, search caches
- **Creates**: Audit records, compliance reports, investigation files, integrity verification records

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: All system features for comprehensive audit coverage, User Authentication for activity attribution
**Dependencies**: Immutable storage infrastructure, compliance reporting tools, search indexing services
**Impacts**: System performance during high activity, storage requirements for long-term retention

### Security & Privacy
- **Access Control**: Role-based audit access with strict controls for sensitive compliance data
- **Data Sensitivity**: Audit log protection, immutable storage security, compliance data encryption
- **Audit Requirements**: Meta-auditing of audit system access and changes for complete accountability
