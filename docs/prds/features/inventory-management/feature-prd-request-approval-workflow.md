# Request & Approval Workflow - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0 | **Complexity Estimate**: High

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Employees need equipment for their work but currently have no structured way to request new equipment or get approvals from management. Without a proper workflow, requests are handled informally, leading to delays, lack of accountability, and poor tracking of equipment procurement decisions.

### Solution Overview
A comprehensive request and approval workflow system that enables employees to submit detailed equipment requests, routes them through multi-tier approval (Team Lead → Admin), tracks status in real-time, and manages the complete procurement process from request to fulfillment.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: All equipment requests properly tracked with clear approval accountability and procurement visibility
**User Success**: Employees can easily request needed equipment and track approval progress while managers can efficiently process team requests

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Request Submission** → Employee details equipment need and justification → System routes to team lead → Request enters approval workflow
2. **Approval Process** → Team lead reviews and approves/rejects → Admin reviews approved requests → Final approval granted
3. **Order Tracking** → Approved requests become trackable orders → Procurement status updated → Equipment delivered and registered

**Key User Stories:**
- **As an employee**, I want to request new equipment with detailed specifications so I can get the tools I need for my work efficiently
- **As a team lead**, I want to approve/reject team equipment requests so I can manage team resources and ensure appropriate spending
- **As an admin**, I want final approval authority on all requests so I can control company spending and maintain budget oversight

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- Request submission system with equipment specifications, justification, and urgency level
- Multi-tier approval workflow: Employee → Team Lead → Admin with proper routing
- Request status tracking with real-time updates and complete history
- Notification system integration for workflow events and status changes
- Request amendment system for rejected requests with resubmission capability
- Order tracking system for post-approval procurement management

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- Bulk approval interface for administrative efficiency with common items
- Request templates for frequently requested equipment types
- Budget impact visibility during approval process
- Request analytics and reporting for procurement insights

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- Direct integration with vendor ordering systems
- Automatic procurement processing without human approval
- Complex budget management beyond basic cost visibility

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- Multi-tier approval required: Team Lead approval followed by Admin approval
- Rejected requests must include reasoning and allow for amendment/resubmission
- Bulk approval available for common items under predefined cost thresholds
- Request ownership cannot be transferred once submitted (maintains accountability)

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: Team lead unavailable for extended period → **Expected Behavior**: Admin notification for direct approval or delegation workflow
- **Scenario**: Request approved but equipment no longer available → **User Experience**: Order status updated with alternative options or cancellation

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: Submit requests, track status, amend rejected requests, approve/reject (for approvers), view team requests
- **System Feedback**: Request confirmations, status updates, approval notifications, rejection reasons
- **Navigation**: Personal requests dashboard, team requests (for leads), all requests (for admins)
- **Visual Requirements**: Request cards with status indicators, approval flow visualization, order tracking timeline

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: Request submission progress, approval processing, status updates
- **Empty States**: New employee with no requests, team lead with no pending approvals, completed requests list
- **Error States**: Request submission failures, approval process errors, order tracking issues
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Full request submission and approval functionality on mobile devices

### Accessibility & Usability
- Clear visual status indicators for request states (Pending, Approved, Rejected, Ordered, Delivered)
- Keyboard accessible request forms and approval interfaces
- Screen reader compatible approval workflow and status information

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Required Inputs**: Equipment description, justification, estimated cost, urgency level
- **Optional Inputs**: Specific model/brand preferences, alternative options, additional notes
- **System Generated**: Request ID, submission timestamp, approval history, status updates

**Data Display:**
- **Primary Information**: Equipment description, request status, submission date, current approver
- **Secondary Information**: Full justification, cost estimates, approval history on detail view
- **Contextual Data**: Team request summaries, approval queue status, order tracking information

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: User accounts (requester/approvers), equipment database (fulfilled requests), order tracking
- **Updates**: Request status, approval decisions, order information, delivery confirmation
- **Creates**: Request records, approval events, order tracking entries, notification triggers

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: User authentication (approval permissions), equipment management (fulfilled orders), notification system
**Dependencies**: Email notifications, approval hierarchy from user management
**Impacts**: Equipment inventory (new additions), budget tracking, procurement processes

### Security & Privacy
- **Access Control**: Users see personal requests plus team requests based on approval authority
- **Data Sensitivity**: Cost estimates and procurement information restricted to appropriate roles
- **Audit Requirements**: All request submissions, approvals, rejections, and amendments logged
