# Software Subscription Management - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P1 | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Employees and teams use various software subscriptions for work, but the company lacks visibility into these costs and subscriptions for budget planning, reimbursement processing, and financial reporting. Without proper tracking, the company cannot optimize licensing costs or ensure compliance with software usage policies.

### Solution Overview
A comprehensive software subscription tracking system that manages individual, team, and company-wide subscriptions with invoice collection, cost allocation, renewal tracking, and reimbursement workflow integration for personal purchases.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: Complete visibility into all software subscription costs with accurate budget tracking and optimized licensing expenses
**User Success**: Employees can easily register subscriptions and request reimbursements while managers can track team software costs

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Subscription Registration** → User enters software details and payment info → System creates subscription record → Invoice collection requested
2. **Cost Tracking** → System categorizes by individual/team/company → Cost allocation calculated → Budget impact tracked
3. **Renewal Management** → System monitors renewal dates → Reminders sent to subscription owners → Budget planning updated

**Key User Stories:**
- **As an employee**, I want to register software I purchased for work so the company can reimburse me and track licensing costs
- **As a manager**, I want to see all software subscriptions used by my team so I can optimize licensing costs and avoid duplicate purchases
- **As an admin**, I want to track all company software expenses so I can provide accurate financial reporting and budget planning

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- Software subscription registry with complete subscription information (name, cost, renewal dates, payment method)
- Invoice management system with file upload, storage, and categorization
- Payment method tracking distinguishing company vs personal payment sources
- Subscription ownership management for individual, team, and company-wide tracking
- Renewal date management with calendar integration and automated reminder system
- Cost allocation and reporting with team and department breakdowns

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- Reimbursement process integration for personal purchase workflows
- Duplicate subscription detection to identify cost optimization opportunities
- Subscription usage analytics and ROI tracking
- Bulk subscription import for initial system setup

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- Direct integration with software vendor APIs for automatic renewal
- Automatic payment processing or subscription management
- Software license compliance monitoring beyond basic tracking

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- Personal purchases require reimbursement workflow integration with clear approval process
- Invoice collection is mandatory for company subscriptions and tax compliance
- Renewal dates must be tracked for accurate budget planning and cash flow management
- Subscription ownership determines visibility and management permissions

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scenario**: Subscription renewed with different cost → **Expected Behavior**: System creates new cost record, maintains historical pricing
- **Scenario**: Team member leaves company with active personal subscriptions → **User Experience**: Subscription ownership transfer or cancellation workflow initiated

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **User Actions**: Register subscriptions, upload invoices, update renewal dates, request reimbursements, assign team subscriptions
- **System Feedback**: Registration confirmations, invoice processing status, renewal reminders, reimbursement status
- **Navigation**: Personal subscriptions, team subscriptions (for managers), company-wide view (for admins)
- **Visual Requirements**: Subscription cards with cost and renewal info, renewal calendar, cost allocation charts

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading/Processing States**: Invoice upload progress, subscription search, cost calculation loading
- **Empty States**: New user with no subscriptions, team with no registered software, upcoming renewals with no items
- **Error States**: Invoice upload failures, invalid subscription data, reimbursement processing errors
- **Mobile/Responsive**: Full subscription management on mobile with optimized file upload

### Accessibility & Usability
- Clear visual indicators for renewal urgency (30 days, 7 days, overdue)
- Keyboard accessible subscription forms and cost tracking interfaces
- Screen reader compatible financial information display

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Required Inputs**: Software name, subscription cost, payment frequency, renewal date, payment method type
- **Optional Inputs**: Description, vendor information, license details, usage notes
- **System Generated**: Subscription ID, registration timestamp, cost calculations, renewal alerts

**Data Display:**
- **Primary Information**: Software name, monthly cost, next renewal date, payment method displayed prominently
- **Secondary Information**: Full subscription details, invoice history, usage notes on detail view
- **Contextual Data**: Team cost summaries, renewal calendars, reimbursement status

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: User accounts (ownership), team structures, invoice files, reimbursement requests
- **Updates**: Subscription costs, renewal dates, ownership assignments, payment methods
- **Creates**: Subscription records, cost allocation entries, renewal reminders, reimbursement requests

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: User authentication (ownership), file management (invoices), approval workflows (reimbursements)
**Dependencies**: File storage system, email notifications, calendar integration
**Impacts**: Financial reporting, budget planning, reimbursement processing

### Security & Privacy
- **Access Control**: Users see personal and team subscriptions based on role, financial data restricted appropriately
- **Data Sensitivity**: Cost information and invoice files protected with proper access controls
- **Audit Requirements**: All subscription changes, cost updates, and reimbursement activities logged

## Acceptance Criteria

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: Register subscription → Upload invoice → Renewal reminder sent → Subscription renewed with updated cost
2. **Error Handling**: Invalid file uploads, missing required fields, renewal date conflicts
3. **Edge Cases**: Subscription ownership transfers, bulk import processing, duplicate subscription detection
4. **Integration**: Subscription data properly feeds into financial reporting and reimbursement workflows

### Detailed User Flows

**Primary Flow - Subscription Registration:**
1. **Entry Point**: User accesses subscription registration from dashboard
