# Expense History & Search - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P1-High | **Complexity Estimate**: Low

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Team members need to track their lunch expenses over time for personal budgeting, expense reporting, and tax purposes. Without searchable expense history, users cannot easily find specific transactions or analyze their team lunch spending patterns.

### Solution Overview
We're building a comprehensive expense history system with powerful search capabilities, filtering options, and data export functionality to help users track, analyze, and report their team lunch expenses effectively.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 70% of users regularly access expense history leading to 40% better personal budget management
**User Success**: Users can quickly find any lunch expense and export data for budgeting or expense reporting needs

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **History Access** ‚Üí User opens expense history ‚Üí System displays chronological list of all lunch expenses with key details
2. **Search & Filter** ‚Üí User searches for specific expenses ‚Üí System returns filtered results with highlighting and context
3. **Detail Review** ‚Üí User selects expense ‚Üí System shows complete information including receipts, participants, and payment status

**Key User Stories:**
- **As a user tracking my spending**, I want to see my lunch expense history so that I can understand my team dining patterns and costs
