# User Authentication System - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Team lunch coordination requires secure user authentication to protect personal data, enable team member identification, and facilitate secure expense sharing. Without proper authentication, the app cannot safely manage team relationships or financial transactions.

### Solution Overview
We're building a comprehensive authentication system supporting multiple registration methods, multi-factor authentication, and secure session management to ensure user data protection while enabling seamless team collaboration.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 95% successful registration completion rate with <2% security incidents
**User Success**: Users can quickly register and securely access their account without friction while maintaining data protection

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **User Registration** → System collects basic info with verification → User receives confirmation and access
2. **User Login** → System authenticates credentials → User gains access to lunch planning features
3. **Security Management** → System provides MFA options → User can enhance account security

**Key User Stories:**
- **As a new user**, I want to create an account quickly so that I can start coordinating lunches with my team
- **As a security-conscious user**, I want multi-factor authentication so that my personal and financial data is protected

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **User Registration**: Email and phone number registration with verification
- **Secure Authentication**: Password-based login with JWT token management
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: SMS and app-based 2FA options
- **Password Management**: Secure reset flow with email/SMS verification
- **Session Management**: Secure token handling with automatic refresh

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Social Login**: Google and Apple Sign-In integration for faster onboarding
- **Device Management**: Track and manage logged-in devices
- **Account Recovery**: Multiple recovery options for account access

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Biometric Authentication**: Fingerprint/face login (future enhancement)
- **Enterprise SSO**: Single sign-on integration (not target user base)

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters with combination of letters, numbers, and symbols
- **Verification Timeout**: Email/SMS verification codes expire after 10 minutes
- **Session Duration**: Login sessions last 30 days with automatic refresh, require re-authentication for sensitive operations
- **Failed Attempts**: Account temporarily locked after 5 failed login attempts within 15 minutes

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Duplicate Registration**: When email already exists → **Expected Behavior**: Offer password reset instead of new registration
- **Verification Failure**: When email/SMS not received → **User Experience**: Resend option with rate limiting and alternative contact methods

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **Registration Form**: Clean, multi-step form with progress indicators and clear field validation
- **Login Interface**: Simple email/password entry with "remember me" and password reset options
- **MFA Setup**: Step-by-step guide for enabling 2FA with QR code or SMS setup
- **Security Dashboard**: Overview of account security status and management options

### User Experience Considerations
- **Minimal Friction**: Registration completes in under 2 minutes with only essential information
- **Clear Security**: Users understand security features without being overwhelmed
- **Error Recovery**: Clear guidance when authentication fails with helpful next steps
- **Mobile Optimization**: Full authentication functionality on mobile devices

### Accessibility & Usability
- **Form Accessibility**: All authentication forms work with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Error Messaging**: Clear, actionable error messages that help users resolve issues
- **Password Visibility**: Toggle option for password fields to assist with entry

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **User Credentials**: Email address, phone number, and securely hashed passwords
- **Profile Information**: Name, profile photo, and basic preferences for team identification
- **Security Settings**: MFA preferences, security questions, and device trust settings
- **Session Data**: Login history, device information, and session management tokens

**Data Display:**
- **Profile Information**: User name and photo for team member identification
- **Security Status**: Current MFA status and last login information
- **Device Management**: List of trusted devices with last access times
- **Account Activity**: Recent login activity and security events

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: All features requiring user identification and authorization
- **Updates**: User profile information and security preferences
- **Creates**: User accounts, authentication tokens, and security audit logs

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: All application features requiring user identification
**Dependencies**: Email and SMS service providers for verification
**Impacts**: Foundational requirement for all other features

### Security & Privacy
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with salt for all stored passwords
- **Token Security**: JWT tokens with secure signing and refresh rotation
- **Data Encryption**: All user credentials encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Privacy Controls**: Users control profile visibility and data sharing preferences

## Acceptance Criteria

### Feature Complete When:
**Core Functionality:**
- [ ] Users can register with email/phone and receive verification within 2 minutes
- [ ] Login process completes in under 10 seconds with valid credentials
- [ ] MFA can be enabled/disabled through user settings
- [ ] Password reset works via both email and SMS with secure token verification

**User Experience:**
- [ ] Registration flow is intuitive and completes without confusion
- [ ] Error messages provide clear guidance for resolution
- [ ] Security features are understandable to non-technical users
- [ ] Mobile registration and login work seamlessly

**Quality Standards:**
- [ ] Authentication system maintains 99.9% uptime
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities are identified and patched within 24 hours
- [ ] User data is protected according to industry security standards

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: New user registers with email, verifies account, and logs in successfully with MFA enabled
2. **Password Recovery**: User forgets password, uses reset flow, and regains account access
3. **Security Incident**: Failed login attempts trigger account protection without affecting legitimate users
4. **Multi-Device**: User accesses account from multiple devices with appropriate security measures

## Dependencies & Constraints

### Prerequisites
- **Infrastructure**: Secure hosting environment with SSL/TLS encryption
- **External Services**: Email service (SendGrid) and SMS service (Twilio) for verification
- **Compliance**: Data protection compliance framework (GDPR, CCPA) implementation

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: Authentication requests complete within 2 seconds
- **Scalability**: System supports 10,000+ concurrent authentication requests
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with graceful handling of service outages
