# Payment Request & Tracking - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: High

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
After bill splitting, collecting payment from team members becomes a manual, time-consuming process that often results in delayed or forgotten payments. Without integrated payment request and tracking, expense reimbursement creates ongoing friction and relationship tension.

### Solution Overview
We're building a comprehensive payment request system that integrates with popular payment platforms, automates request generation from bill splits, tracks payment status in real-time, and provides gentle reminder capabilities to ensure timely reimbursement.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 90% of payment requests result in completion within 48 hours with 95% user satisfaction
**User Success**: Bill payers receive reimbursement quickly and seamlessly without manual follow-up or awkward conversations

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Request Generation** ‚Üí Bill split completed ‚Üí System creates payment requests with amounts and context ‚Üí Requests sent via preferred payment platforms
2. **Payment Processing** ‚Üí Recipients receive requests ‚Üí System provides easy payment options ‚Üí Payments processed through integrated platforms
3. **Status Tracking** ‚Üí System monitors payment status ‚Üí All participants see real-time updates ‚Üí Completion triggers confirmation notifications

**Key User Stories:**
- **As someone who paid the restaurant bill**, I want to request payment easily so that I get reimbursed quickly through platforms my team already uses
- **As someone who owes money**, I want clear payment instructions so that I can pay the correct amount through my preferred method

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Multi-Platform Integration**: Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, and Cash App integration with secure API connections
- **Automated Request Generation**: Direct creation from bill split results with amounts, context, and recipient information
- **Real-Time Status Tracking**: Live payment status updates with webhook integration and manual confirmation options
- **Smart Reminder System**: Automated follow-up notifications with escalating frequency and customizable timing

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Payment Method Learning**: Platform preference detection based on successful payment history
- **Bulk Request Management**: Simultaneous request generation for multiple participants with status aggregation
- **Payment Confirmation Verification**: Receipt validation and duplicate payment prevention

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Direct Payment Processing**: Integration with existing platforms, not custom payment processing
- **International Payments**: Focus on US-based payment platforms initially

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Request Timing**: Payment requests generated immediately after bill split confirmation with 48-hour expected response time
- **Platform Selection**: Use recipient's preferred payment platform with fallback to manual confirmation options
- **Amount Validation**: Request amounts must exactly match bill split calculations with no manual adjustments
- **Reminder Escalation**: Gentle reminders at 24 hours, 48 hours, and weekly thereafter with customizable frequency

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Payment Platform Failure**: When integrated service unavailable ‚Üí **Expected Behavior**: Queue requests with manual payment option and platform retry
- **Duplicate Payments**: When multiple payments received for same request ‚Üí **User Experience**: Automatic refund process with notification to all parties

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **Request Dashboard**: Overview of all outstanding payment requests with status, amounts, and timing information
- **Payment Options**: Clear platform selection with one-tap payment initiation for common services
- **Status Visualization**: Real-time payment tracking with progress indicators and completion confirmation
- **Reminder Management**: User control over reminder frequency and escalation with relationship-sensitive options

### User Experience Considerations
- **Payment Simplicity**: One-tap payment completion through integrated platforms without app switching
- **Status Transparency**: All participants can see payment progress without revealing individual financial details

- **Payment History**: Complete record of all payment requests and completions with searchable history
- **Platform Health**: Integration status and availability of connected payment services
- **Reminder Schedule**: Upcoming reminder delivery with user control over timing and content

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: Bill splitting results, user payment preferences, and team coordination data
- **Updates**: Payment completion status, reminder effectiveness, and platform usage analytics
- **Creates**: Payment completion confirmations, reimbursement records, and team coordination closure

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: Intelligent Bill Splitting (FT-010), Real-time Notification System (FT-016)
**Dependencies**: Payment platform APIs, webhook infrastructure, and secure transaction handling
**Impacts**: Completes expense coordination cycle and enables team lunch coordination closure

### Security & Privacy
- **Payment Security**: All payment platform integration uses OAuth with minimal permission scope
- **Transaction Privacy**: Payment details protected with encryption and appropriate access controls
- **Platform Compliance**: Integration follows payment platform security and compliance requirements
