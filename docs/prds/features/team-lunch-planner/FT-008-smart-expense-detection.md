# Smart Expense Detection - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
After team lunches, expense entry becomes a manual, error-prone process where team members forget details, misremember amounts, or fail to associate expenses with the correct lunch event. This creates friction in bill splitting and expense tracking.

### Solution Overview
We're building an intelligent expense detection system that uses location services, timing analysis, and event context to automatically detect when users are at planned lunch locations and pre-populate expense entry with relevant event and participant information.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 80% of lunch expenses are automatically detected leading to 60% faster bill splitting completion
**User Success**: Users can capture lunch expenses with minimal manual entry, automatically linked to correct events and participants

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Automatic Detection** → User arrives at lunch restaurant → System detects location match and prompts expense capture
2. **Context Pre-filling** → User initiates expense entry → System auto-populates restaurant, participants, and event details
3. **Quick Confirmation** → User reviews pre-filled information → System creates expense record ready for bill splitting

**Key User Stories:**
- **As someone who pays restaurant bills**, I want automatic expense detection so that I don't have to remember and enter all the lunch details manually
- **As a team member**, I want my lunch expenses automatically linked to events so that bill splitting has all the right context

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Location-Based Detection**: GPS monitoring to identify when users arrive at confirmed lunch restaurants
- **Event Association Logic**: Intelligent matching of location visits to planned lunch events based on timing and participants
- **Context Pre-filling**: Automatic population of restaurant name, participant list, event details, and estimated timing
- **Manual Override Capabilities**: User control to correct auto-detected information or manually link expenses to events

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Detection Sensitivity Tuning**: User control over location detection radius and timing sensitivity
- **Multiple Event Handling**: Smart disambiguation when multiple lunch events occur at same restaurant
- **Expense Prediction**: Estimated bill amounts based on restaurant type and participant count

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Payment Method Detection**: Focus on expense capture, not payment method identification
- **Receipt Auto-capture**: Location detection only, not automatic receipt scanning initiation

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Detection Window**: Monitor location within 2-hour window around planned lunch time for automatic detection
- **Location Accuracy**: Trigger detection within 100-meter radius of restaurant location with GPS confidence validation
- **Event Matching**: Associate location visits with lunch events based on timing, participants, and restaurant match
- **Privacy Respect**: Location tracking only during active lunch coordination periods with user consent

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Multiple Restaurants**: When user visits multiple restaurants same day → **Expected Behavior**: Smart disambiguation based on event timing and participant context
- **Location Inaccuracy**: When GPS places user near but not at restaurant → **User Experience**: Prompt for confirmation with manual correction option

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **Detection Notifications**: Subtle prompts when lunch location detected with quick expense capture options
- **Pre-filled Forms**: Expense entry with restaurant, participants, and timing automatically populated
- **Detection Settings**: User control over location monitoring sensitivity and notification preferences
- **Manual Linking**: Option to manually associate expenses with lunch events when auto-detection fails

### User Experience Considerations
- **Battery Efficiency**: Location monitoring optimized to minimize battery drain during lunch coordination
- **Privacy Transparency**: Clear indication when location tracking is active with easy disable options
- **Detection Reliability**: Consistent location detection without false positives or missed lunch visits
- **Offline Handling**: Detection queuing when connectivity poor with sync when connection restored

### Accessibility & Usability
- **Location Accessibility**: Detection notifications work with screen readers and provide clear context
- **Settings Accessibility**: Location preference controls accessible via keyboard and assistive technology
- **Alternative Input**: Manual expense entry always available when auto-detection unavailable

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Location Data**: GPS coordinates, timing stamps, and location accuracy measurements during lunch windows
- **Event Context**: Planned lunch details, restaurant locations, participant lists, and timing schedules
- **Detection Results**: Successful matches, false positives, user corrections, and detection effectiveness
- **User Preferences**: Location tracking consent, detection sensitivity settings, and notification preferences

**Data Display:**
- **Detection Status**: Active location monitoring indicator with current lunch event context
- **Pre-filled Information**: Restaurant details, participant lists, and timing automatically populated in expense forms
- **Detection History**: Record of successful automatic detections with accuracy and user satisfaction tracking
- **Privacy Controls**: Clear location tracking status with granular control over detection features

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: Confirmed lunch events, restaurant data, and participant information
- **Updates**: Expense creation triggers, bill splitting preparation, and event completion status
- **Creates**: Expense records, detection analytics, and location-based coordination effectiveness data

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: Restaurant Selection & Confirmation (FT-007), Receipt Scanning & OCR (FT-009), Intelligent Bill Splitting (FT-010)
**Dependencies**: Device location services and confirmed lunch event data
**Impacts**: Triggers expense entry workflow and provides context for bill splitting features

### Security & Privacy
- **Location Privacy**: GPS data encrypted and used only for lunch coordination with automatic deletion
- **Consent Management**: Clear opt-in for location tracking with granular control over usage
- **Data Minimization**: Store only necessary location information with automatic cleanup after event completion

## Acceptance Criteria
