# Restaurant Selection & Confirmation - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: Low

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
After receiving restaurant recommendations, teams need a clear process to make final selections and confirm lunch details. Without structured decision-making and confirmation, lunch coordination remains incomplete and participants are uncertain about final plans.

### Solution Overview
We're building a streamlined restaurant selection system that facilitates team input on recommendations, enables final choice confirmation, and automatically communicates complete lunch details to all participants.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 95% of restaurant selections result in confirmed lunch attendance and successful coordination
**User Success**: Teams can quickly agree on restaurant choice and all participants receive clear, complete lunch information

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Selection Review** ‚Üí Organizer reviews restaurant recommendations ‚Üí System displays options with team preference matching
2. **Team Input** ‚Üí Organizer facilitates team choice ‚Üí System collects preferences and displays consensus options
3. **Final Confirmation** ‚Üí Organizer selects restaurant ‚Üí System locks details and notifies all participants with complete information

**Key User Stories:**
