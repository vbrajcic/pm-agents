# Intelligent Bill Splitting - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Team meals create complex bill-splitting scenarios with shared items, different consumption patterns, and varying tax/tip preferences. Manual calculation is error-prone, time-consuming, and often leads to disputes or unfair cost allocation.

### Solution Overview
We're building an intelligent bill splitting system that handles multiple split methods, automatically distributes tax and tip proportionally, and provides clear breakdowns so everyone understands and agrees with their portion.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 95% of split bills are accepted without dispute and 80% of users prefer app splitting over manual calculation
**User Success**: Users can split any restaurant bill fairly and accurately in under 2 minutes with complete transparency

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Bill Input** → User enters bill details from receipt → System parses items, amounts, tax, and tip automatically
2. **Split Configuration** → User selects participants and split method → System calculates individual amounts with real-time updates
3. **Review & Confirm** → User and participants review breakdown → System creates payment requests with clear itemization

**Key User Stories:**
- **As someone who paid the bill**, I want to split costs fairly so that everyone pays exactly their share without manual calculation
- **As a team member**, I want to see exactly what I owe so that I understand the charges and agree they're fair

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Multiple Split Methods**: Equal split, itemized split, percentage-based split, and custom amount allocation
- **Tax & Tip Distribution**: Proportional allocation of tax and tip based on subtotal consumption with rounding handling
- **Participant Management**: Select which team members participated in the meal with role-based allocation options
- **Split Calculation Engine**: Real-time mathematical accuracy with penny-perfect allocation and dispute prevention

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Split Templates**: Common patterns saved for team (equal split, host pays tip, etc.)
- **Visual Breakdown**: Clear charts showing who owes what with itemized explanations
- **Adjustment Capabilities**: Manual override options for special circumstances or shared items

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Complex Shared Items**: Focus on individual items or simple sharing, not complex shared item calculations
- **Historical Split Analysis**: Individual split tracking only, not long-term spending pattern analysis

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Mathematical Accuracy**: All splits must total exactly to bill amount with proper rounding allocation
- **Proportional Distribution**: Tax and tip distributed based on each person's subtotal percentage
- **Minimum Allocation**: Each participant must have positive amount unless explicitly excluded from charges
- **Split Validation**: System prevents splits that create negative amounts or exceed bill total

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Rounding Discrepancies**: When amounts don't divide evenly → **Expected Behavior**: Allocate extra cents to bill payer or highest amount
- **Zero Consumption**: When participant ordered nothing → **User Experience**: Option to exclude or allocate minimum amount (tax/tip only)

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **Split Method Selection**: Clear visual options for equal, itemized, percentage, and custom split approaches
- **Real-time Calculation**: Live updates showing each person's amount as split parameters change
- **Itemized Display**: Clear breakdown showing subtotal, tax portion, tip portion, and total for each participant
- **Confirmation Interface**: Summary view requiring acknowledgment before payment request generation

### User Experience Considerations
- **Quick Equal Split**: Most common scenario (equal split) completes in under 30 seconds
- **Transparency**: Every calculation clearly explained so participants understand their charges
- **Error Prevention**: Validation prevents impossible splits before calculation completion
- **Mobile Optimization**: Full splitting functionality optimized for mobile use at restaurant table

### Accessibility & Usability
- **Calculation Accessibility**: All split amounts clearly labeled and accessible via screen readers
- **Visual Clarity**: Split breakdowns use clear typography and spacing for easy comprehension
- **Touch Optimization**: Split selection and adjustment controls sized for accurate touch interaction

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Bill Details**: Itemized expenses, subtotal, tax amount, tip amount, and total bill value
- **Participant Data**: Selected team members with individual consumption patterns and preferences
- **Split Configuration**: Chosen method, custom adjustments, and final amount allocation
- **Payment Tracking**: Individual amounts owed with payment status and completion confirmation

**Data Display:**
- **Split Summary**: Each participant's amount with breakdown of subtotal, tax, and tip portions
- **Method Explanation**: Clear description of how split was calculated and why amounts are fair
- **Payment Status**: Real-time tracking of who has paid and outstanding amounts
- **Receipt Archive**: Original bill data linked to split records for reference and disputes

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: Receipt scanning, expense tracking, and payment request systems
- **Updates**: Individual expense records and team coordination history
- **Creates**: Payment obligations, expense documentation, and split effectiveness metrics

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: Receipt Scanning & OCR (FT-009), Payment Request & Tracking (FT-011)
**Dependencies**: Accurate bill data from receipt scanning or manual entry
**Impacts**: Generates payment requests and updates individual expense tracking

### Security & Privacy
- **Split Privacy**: Bill splitting details visible only to meal participants
- **Payment Security**: Split amounts protected during payment request transmission
- **Receipt Security**: Bill images and data secured with same standards as financial documents

## Acceptance Criteria

### Feature Complete When:
**Core Functionality:**
- [ ] Equal splits divide amounts accurately with proper tax and tip allocation
- [ ] Itemized splits handle individual item allocation with shared cost distribution
- [ ] Custom splits support manual adjustments while maintaining mathematical accuracy
- [ ] All split methods provide clear breakdown that participants can verify and accept

**User Experience:**
- [ ] Split selection and calculation interface is intuitive for restaurant table use
- [ ] Participants can understand their charges without additional explanation
- [ ] Split completion integrates seamlessly with payment request generation
- [ ] Error handling guides users to valid split configurations without frustration

**Quality Standards:**
- [ ] Mathematical accuracy maintained across all split methods and edge cases
- [ ] Split calculations complete within 5 seconds for standard restaurant bills
- [ ] Generated payment requests contain accurate amounts and clear explanations

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: Team of 4 orders individual items, splits itemized bill accurately with proper tax/tip distribution
2. **Equal Split**: Group orders family-style with sharing, equal split handles tax and tip fairly
3. **Complex Split**: Mixed individual and shared items with custom adjustments for special circumstances
4. **Edge Case**: One team member orders significantly more expensive item, proportional splitting works correctly
