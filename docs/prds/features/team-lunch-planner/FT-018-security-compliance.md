# Security & Compliance - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: High

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Team lunch coordination involves sensitive financial data, payment processing, and personal information that requires enterprise-grade security and regulatory compliance. Without comprehensive security measures, users won't trust the app with payment data and business usage will be impossible.

### Solution Overview
We're implementing bank-level security infrastructure with end-to-end encryption, PCI DSS compliance for payment processing, comprehensive audit logging, and privacy controls to ensure all user data is protected to industry standards.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: Zero security incidents with successful compliance audits and enterprise customer adoption
**User Success**: Complete confidence in data security with granular privacy control over all personal and financial information

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Security Setup** → User configures privacy and security preferences → System implements protection with clear status confirmation
2. **Secure Operations** → User coordinates lunches and processes payments → System protects all data transparently with security indicators
3. **Privacy Management** → User adjusts sharing and retention settings → System respects all choices immediately with audit trail

**Key User Stories:**
- **As a user handling payment data**, I want bank-level security so that my financial information is completely protected from breaches and unauthorized access
- **As a privacy-conscious user**, I want complete control over my data so that I decide what's collected, shared, and how long it's retained

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All financial and personal data encrypted at rest and in transit using AES-256 standards
- **PCI DSS Compliance**: Full compliance for payment processing with regular audits and certification maintenance
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Complete security event tracking with tamper-proof logs and user-accessible audit trails
- **Privacy Control Framework**: Granular settings for data collection, sharing, retention, and deletion with automated enforcement

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Advanced Threat Detection**: Real-time monitoring for suspicious activity with automated response and user notification
- **Security Dashboard**: User-friendly overview of security status, privacy settings, and recent activity
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated compliance verification and documentation for business users

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Advanced Security Operations**: Focus on prevention and detection, not complex incident response
- **Multi-Tenant Enterprise**: Individual and team security model, not complex enterprise architecture

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Encryption Standards**: All sensitive data uses AES-256 encryption with secure key management and rotation
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with principle of least privilege and mandatory authentication for sensitive operations
- **Data Retention**: Automatic data deletion according to user preferences and regulatory requirements
- **Compliance Verification**: Continuous monitoring and regular third-party audits for security and privacy compliance

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Security Incident**: When breach detected → **Expected Behavior**: Immediate containment, user notification, and transparent remediation process
- **Compliance Violation**: When data handling violates regulations → **User Experience**: Immediate correction, user notification, and process improvement

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **Privacy Settings**: Comprehensive, understandable controls for all data collection and sharing preferences
- **Security Status**: Clear indicators showing current protection level and any recommended security actions
- **Audit Access**: User-friendly interface for viewing security events and data access history
- **Incident Communication**: Clear, non-technical security notifications with actionable guidance and impact assessment

### User Experience Considerations
- **Transparency**: All security measures and data handling practices explained clearly without technical jargon
- **Control Granularity**: Privacy settings provide meaningful control without overwhelming complexity
- **Trust Building**: Security features visible and understandable to build user confidence in data protection
- **Minimal Friction**: Security measures don't impede normal lunch coordination workflows

### Accessibility & Usability
- **Security Accessibility**: All privacy controls and security features work with assistive technology
- **Clear Communication**: Security information presented in accessible, plain language formats
- **Alternative Access**: Security features accommodate users with different technical comfort levels

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Security Events**: Authentication attempts, data access patterns, system events, and threat indicators
- **Privacy Preferences**: User choices for data collection, sharing, retention, and deletion
- **Compliance Data**: Audit trails, compliance verification records, and regulatory reporting data
- **Encryption Keys**: Secure key management with rotation schedules and access logging

**Data Display:**
- **Security Dashboard**: Current protection status, recent activity, and recommended security actions
- **Privacy Center**: Complete privacy control interface with clear impact explanations
- **Audit Timeline**: Searchable security event history with context and resolution tracking
- **Compliance Status**: Regulatory compliance verification with certification display and renewal tracking

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: All application features requiring data protection and privacy enforcement
- **Updates**: Security posture, compliance status, and privacy enforcement effectiveness
- **Creates**: Security audit records, compliance documentation, and privacy compliance verification

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: All features handling sensitive data including payments, personal information, and coordination data
**Dependencies**: Encryption services, compliance frameworks, and security monitoring infrastructure
**Impacts**: Foundational requirement affecting all data handling, storage, and processing

### Security & Privacy
- **Meta-Security**: Security infrastructure itself protected with additional layers and monitoring
- **Privacy by Design**: Privacy protection built into all features from inception, not added afterward
- **Compliance Automation**: Continuous compliance monitoring with automated reporting and verification
