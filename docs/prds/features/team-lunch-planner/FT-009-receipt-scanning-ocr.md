# Receipt Scanning & OCR - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: High

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Manual expense entry from restaurant receipts is time-consuming, error-prone, and creates friction in the bill-splitting process. Team members avoid using expense tracking features when data entry requires significant manual effort.

### Solution Overview
We're building an intelligent receipt scanning system that uses OCR technology to automatically extract expense data from restaurant receipts, with validation and correction capabilities to ensure accuracy for bill splitting.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 85% of users prefer receipt scanning over manual entry, leading to 60% higher expense tracking adoption
**User Success**: Users can capture receipt data in under 30 seconds with 95%+ accuracy for bill splitting calculations

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Receipt Capture** → User photographs receipt with camera → System processes image and extracts text
2. **Data Validation** → System presents extracted data for review → User confirms or corrects information
3. **Expense Creation** → System creates expense record with receipt data → User proceeds to bill splitting

**Key User Stories:**
- **As someone entering expenses**, I want to scan receipts so that I don't have to type everything manually
- **As a team member splitting bills**, I want accurate data extraction so that bill splitting calculations are correct

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Camera Integration**: High-quality receipt photo capture with automatic edge detection and cropping
- **OCR Processing**: Text extraction from receipt images with confidence scoring for each field
- **Data Parsing**: Intelligent structuring of receipt text into itemized expenses, tax, tip, and total amounts
- **Validation Interface**: Review screen with extracted data and manual correction capabilities
- **Fallback Support**: Manual entry option when OCR fails or produces low-confidence results

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Multi-Receipt Scanning**: Batch processing for multiple receipts from same event
- **Receipt Enhancement**: Image preprocessing to improve OCR accuracy (lighting correction, perspective adjustment)
- **Learning System**: Improve OCR accuracy based on user corrections and feedback

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Handwritten Receipt Support**: Focus on printed receipts from POS systems
- **International Currency**: US dollar receipts only in initial version

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Confidence Threshold**: Only auto-populate fields with OCR confidence >85%; flag lower confidence for user review
- **Validation Requirements**: Total amount, date, and merchant name must be validated before proceeding to bill splitting
- **Image Quality**: Reject blurry or unreadable images with guidance for retaking photo
- **Data Retention**: Store receipt images securely for 90 days for audit purposes

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **OCR Failure**: When text extraction fails → **Expected Behavior**: Offer manual entry with option to retry photo
- **Partial Recognition**: When some fields unreadable → **User Experience**: Highlight missing fields for manual completion

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **Camera Component**: Full-screen camera view with receipt outline guide and capture button
- **Image Preview**: Photo review with retake option before processing
- **OCR Results Display**: Extracted data in editable form fields with confidence indicators
- **Manual Entry Fallback**: Complete expense entry form when OCR unavailable

### User Experience Considerations
- **Quick Capture**: Receipt photographing process takes <10 seconds with clear guidance
- **Processing Feedback**: Clear indication of OCR processing status with estimated completion time
- **Error Prevention**: Validation warnings for suspicious amounts or missing required fields
- **Mobile Optimization**: Camera and review interfaces optimized for mobile device usage

### Accessibility & Usability
- **Camera Accessibility**: Voice guidance for users with visual impairments during photo capture
- **OCR Review**: Screen reader support for extracted data validation
- **Manual Alternative**: Full functionality available without camera for accessibility needs

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Receipt Images**: High-resolution photos with metadata (timestamp, location if available)
- **OCR Text Output**: Raw extracted text with confidence scores for each recognized element
- **Parsed Data**: Structured expense information including items, amounts, tax, tip, and totals
- **User Corrections**: Manual edits and feedback for improving OCR accuracy

**Data Display:**
- **Extracted Fields**: Restaurant name, date, itemized expenses, subtotal, tax, tip, and total
- **Confidence Indicators**: Visual cues showing OCR confidence level for each field
- **Correction Interface**: Editable fields with original OCR text and user modifications
- **Receipt Archive**: Stored images with associated expense records for reference

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: Smart expense detection, bill splitting, and expense history features
- **Updates**: Expense records with receipt data and accuracy feedback for ML improvement
- **Creates**: Digitized expense records with supporting receipt documentation

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: Smart Expense Detection (FT-008), Intelligent Bill Splitting (FT-010)
**Dependencies**: OCR service provider and image processing infrastructure
**Impacts**: Enables automated bill splitting and reduces manual data entry requirements

### Security & Privacy
- **Image Security**: Receipt photos encrypted at rest and in transit with secure deletion
- **OCR Privacy**: Text processing occurs in secure environment without data sharing
- **Data Retention**: Clear retention policy with automatic deletion after specified period

## Acceptance Criteria

### Feature Complete When:
**Core Functionality:**
- [ ] Receipt scanning achieves 95%+ accuracy for total amounts and key expense data
- [ ] OCR processing completes within 5 seconds for standard restaurant receipts
- [ ] Manual correction interface allows fixing any recognition errors intuitively
- [ ] Fallback to manual entry always available when OCR fails

**User Experience:**
- [ ] Receipt photographing process is intuitive and completes quickly
- [ ] OCR results display clearly indicates confidence levels and required corrections
- [ ] Camera interface works consistently across supported mobile devices

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: User photographs clear restaurant receipt and all key data extracts accurately for immediate bill splitting
2. **Low Quality Image**: Blurry or poorly lit receipt triggers retake guidance and manual entry fallback
3. **Partial Recognition**: Some receipt fields unreadable, user completes missing information manually
4. **Complex Receipt**: Multi-page or itemized receipt with various charges processes correctly

## Dependencies & Constraints
