# Restaurant Recommendation Engine - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: High

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Teams struggle to find restaurants that satisfy everyone's dietary preferences, budget constraints, and location requirements. Manual restaurant research is time-consuming and often results in choices that don't work for all team members.

### Solution Overview
We're building an intelligent recommendation engine that analyzes team preferences, budget constraints, and location factors to suggest restaurants that work for the entire group, with detailed information to support decision-making.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 80% of suggested restaurants receive positive team feedback and 70% of lunch events use recommended venues
**User Success**: Users find suitable restaurants for their team in under 2 minutes with 90% satisfaction rate

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Event Parameters Set** → System analyzes team preferences and constraints → System generates ranked restaurant suggestions
2. **User Reviews Options** → System provides detailed restaurant information → User can filter and compare options
3. **Final Selection** → System facilitates team input → User confirms restaurant choice with all details

**Key User Stories:**
- **As a lunch organizer**, I want restaurant suggestions that match our preferences so that everyone is happy with the choice
- **As a budget-conscious team member**, I want options within our price range so that no one feels uncomfortable about cost

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Preference-Based Filtering**: Match restaurants to team dietary restrictions, cuisine preferences, and accessibility needs
- **Budget Constraint Application**: Filter options by price range with per-person cost estimation
- **Location-Based Search**: Geographic filtering by distance from office/meeting point with travel time estimates
- **Restaurant Detail Display**: Comprehensive information including menus, photos, reviews, and contact details

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Smart Ranking Algorithm**: ML-based recommendation scoring considering team history and preference weights
- **Real-Time Availability**: Integration with reservation systems to show table availability
- **Team Preference Learning**: Improve recommendations based on past selections and feedback

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Direct Reservation Booking**: Focus on recommendation, not booking integration
- **Custom Menu Creation**: Work with existing restaurant menus only

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Preference Hierarchy**: Dietary restrictions override cuisine preferences; accessibility needs are absolute requirements
- **Budget Filtering**: Only show restaurants where estimated per-person cost fits within 90% of team budget
- **Distance Limits**: Default 2-mile radius from specified location, expandable to 5 miles if insufficient options
- **Rating Threshold**: Only recommend restaurants with 3.5+ star average rating and recent reviews

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **No Matches**: When no restaurants meet all criteria → **Expected Behavior**: Relaxed filtering with explanation of compromises made
- **Limited Options**: When <3 restaurants available → **User Experience**: Expand search radius and suggest alternative times/dates

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **Recommendation Cards**: Visual restaurant cards with key information, ratings, and quick selection options
- **Filter Controls**: Easy-to-use filters for cuisine type, price range, distance, and special requirements
- **Detailed View**: Expandable restaurant information with menus, photos, and reviews
- **Comparison Mode**: Side-by-side comparison of multiple restaurant options

### User Experience Considerations
- **Quick Decision Making**: Essential information visible without clicking through multiple screens
- **Visual Appeal**: Restaurant photos and ratings prominently displayed to aid selection
- **Mobile Optimization**: Full functionality on mobile devices for on-the-go planning
- **Loading Performance**: Recommendations appear within 3 seconds of parameter setting

### Accessibility & Usability
- **Filter Accessibility**: All filtering controls work with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Visual Information**: Restaurant ratings and key details available through multiple visual cues
- **Mobile Touch**: Restaurant cards and filters optimized for touch interaction

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Restaurant Database**: Comprehensive venue information including location, cuisine type, price range, and contact details
- **User Preferences**: Team member dietary restrictions, cuisine preferences, and accessibility requirements
- **Budget Constraints**: Per-person spending limits and total event budget parameters
- **Location Context**: Event location and preferred travel distance/time limits

**Data Display:**
- **Restaurant Cards**: Name, cuisine type, price range, rating, distance, and key features
- **Detailed Information**: Full menus, photo galleries, review summaries, and operational details
- **Comparison Views**: Side-by-side feature and pricing comparison for final selection
- **Map Integration**: Geographic visualization of restaurant locations relative to event location

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: User profile preferences, event parameters, and team member requirements
- **Updates**: Restaurant availability, pricing, and review data from external APIs
- **Creates**: Recommendation history, user feedback, and preference learning data

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: User Profile & Preferences (FT-002), Lunch Event Creation (FT-003)
**Dependencies**: Third-party restaurant data APIs (Google Places, Yelp) and mapping services
**Impacts**: Restaurant selection influences expense detection and bill splitting features

### Security & Privacy
- **API Security**: Secure integration with restaurant data providers using encrypted connections
- **User Privacy**: Team preferences protected and not shared with external services
- **Data Caching**: Restaurant data cached locally with appropriate refresh intervals

## Acceptance Criteria

### Feature Complete When:
**Core Functionality:**
- [ ] Recommendations respect all set dietary restrictions and accessibility requirements
- [ ] Budget constraints accurately filter options with realistic per-person cost estimates
- [ ] Location filtering works within specified distance parameters
- [ ] Restaurant details provide sufficient information for informed decision-making

**User Experience:**
- [ ] Recommendation generation completes within 3 seconds for typical search parameters
- [ ] Filter adjustments update results in real-time without page reloads
- [ ] Restaurant information is comprehensive enough to avoid external research
- [ ] Mobile interface provides full functionality for restaurant selection

**Quality Standards:**
- [ ] Recommended restaurants have current, accurate information (menu, hours, contact)
- [ ] Preference matching accuracy exceeds 90% based on user feedback
- [ ] System handles edge cases gracefully with helpful guidance for users

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: Team with mixed dietary preferences finds suitable restaurant within budget and location constraints
2. **Constrained Search**: Highly restricted preferences (vegan, gluten-free, wheelchair accessible) still yield viable options
3. **Budget Optimization**: Expensive area search finds appropriate options within modest team budget
4. **No Perfect Match**: When ideal restaurant doesn't exist, system provides best available options with clear trade-offs

## Dependencies & Constraints

### Prerequisites
- **External APIs**: Google Places and/or Yelp integration for restaurant data and reviews
- **Mapping Services**: Google Maps or similar for location services and distance calculations
- **Data Processing**: Analytics capability for preference matching and recommendation ranking

### Performance Requirements
- **Search Speed**: Restaurant recommendations generate within 3 seconds for standard parameters
- **Data Freshness**: Restaurant information updates at least weekly with critical data (hours, phone) daily
