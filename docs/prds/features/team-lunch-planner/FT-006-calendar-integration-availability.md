# Calendar Integration & Availability - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P1-High | **Complexity Estimate**: High

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Team lunch scheduling often conflicts with meetings and commitments, leading to poor attendance and last-minute cancellations. Without calendar integration, organizers cannot see team availability and frequently schedule lunches that don't work for key participants.

### Solution Overview
We're building comprehensive calendar integration that checks team member availability, identifies optimal time slots, detects conflicts, and suggests alternative timing to maximize participation in team lunches.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 60% reduction in lunch scheduling conflicts and 40% improvement in attendance rates
**User Success**: Organizers can quickly find times that work for the whole team without manual coordination

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Availability Check** ‚Üí Organizer selects potential lunch time ‚Üí System checks all participant calendars ‚Üí System displays availability overview
2. **Conflict Resolution** ‚Üí System identifies scheduling conflicts ‚Üí System suggests alternative times ‚Üí Organizer selects optimal slot
3. **Calendar Integration** ‚Üí Team confirms lunch time ‚Üí System creates calendar events automatically ‚Üí All participants receive calendar invitations

**Key User Stories:**
- **As an organizer**, I want to see team availability so that I can pick lunch times that work for everyone
- **As a team member**, I want lunch events added to my calendar automatically so that I don't double-book or forget

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Multi-Platform Calendar Integration**: Google Calendar, Outlook, and Apple Calendar connectivity with OAuth authentication
- **Availability Analysis**: Free/busy time checking across all participants with conflict identification
- **Smart Time Suggestions**: Algorithm-based recommendations for optimal lunch timing based on team availability
- **Automatic Event Creation**: Calendar event generation with lunch details, location, and participant list

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Recurring Availability Patterns**: Learning common free times for regular lunch scheduling optimization
- **Meeting Buffer Management**: Respect meeting preparation time and travel time between calendar events
- **Calendar Conflict Warnings**: Proactive alerts when scheduling conflicts with important meetings

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Complex Scheduling Optimization**: Focus on availability checking, not advanced scheduling algorithms
- **Calendar Event Modification**: Read-only calendar access for availability, lunch events managed within app

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Availability Window**: Check availability 1 hour before to 2 hours after proposed lunch time for buffer
- **Conflict Definition**: Any calendar event during lunch window considered conflict requiring resolution
- **Permission Respect**: Only access calendar free/busy information, not detailed event contents
- **Update Frequency**: Refresh availability data within 15 minutes of lunch scheduling to ensure accuracy

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Calendar Access Denied**: When user denies calendar permission ‚Üí **Expected Behavior**: Manual availability input option with reduced functionality
- **Sync Delays**: When calendar data outdated ‚Üí **User Experience**: Display last sync time with refresh option and conflict warnings

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **Availability Visualization**: Clear calendar grid showing free/busy times for all participants with conflict highlighting
- **Time Slot Suggestions**: Ranked list of optimal lunch times with participation rates and conflict summaries
- **Permission Management**: Simple calendar connection flow with clear explanation of access scope
- **Conflict Resolution**: Alternative time suggestions with impact analysis and participation optimization

### User Experience Considerations
- **Privacy Respect**: Show availability without revealing specific meeting details or calendar content
- **Quick Setup**: Calendar connection completes in under 2 minutes with minimal required permissions
- **Conflict Clarity**: Clear visual indication of scheduling conflicts with helpful resolution suggestions
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Consistent experience regardless of participant calendar platform mix

### Accessibility & Usability
- **Calendar Accessibility**: Availability displays work with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Visual Clarity**: Availability status uses multiple indicators beyond color for accessibility
- **Permission Clarity**: Calendar access requests clearly explain scope and privacy protection

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Calendar Connections**: OAuth tokens, calendar platform types, and sync status for each user
- **Availability Data**: Free/busy information, meeting durations, and conflict identification
- **Usage Patterns**: Successful lunch timing patterns and team availability trends
- **Integration Health**: Sync status, error rates, and calendar access reliability metrics

**Data Display:**
- **Availability Grid**: Visual calendar showing team member availability with conflict highlighting
- **Suggested Times**: Ranked list of optimal lunch slots with participation rates and conflict analysis
- **Sync Status**: Current calendar connection status with last update times and refresh options
- **Conflict Summary**: Clear breakdown of scheduling conflicts with resolution recommendations

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: User profiles, lunch event creation, and invitation systems
- **Updates**: Event scheduling decisions, availability pattern learning, and conflict resolution effectiveness
- **Creates**: Calendar events, availability analytics, and scheduling optimization data

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: Lunch Event Creation (FT-003), Invitation & RSVP System (FT-004)
**Dependencies**: Calendar API access and OAuth authentication infrastructure
**Impacts**: Influences lunch timing decisions and automatic calendar event creation

### Security & Privacy
- **Calendar Privacy**: Minimal permission scope accessing only free/busy information, not event details
- **Token Security**: OAuth tokens encrypted and stored with calendar provider security standards
- **Data Minimization**: Store only necessary availability information with automatic cleanup

## Acceptance Criteria

### Feature Complete When:
**Core Functionality:**
- [ ] Calendar integration works reliably with Google, Outlook, and Apple Calendar platforms
- [ ] Availability checking accurately identifies conflicts and free time slots
- [ ] Time suggestions optimize for maximum participation while respecting individual schedules
- [ ] Calendar event creation works seamlessly across all integrated platforms

**User Experience:**
- [ ] Calendar connection process is intuitive and completes quickly without user confusion
- [ ] Availability visualization clearly shows optimal lunch timing without revealing private information
- [ ] Conflict resolution suggestions are helpful and lead to successful lunch scheduling
- [ ] Calendar events contain appropriate lunch information and participant details

**Quality Standards:**
- [ ] Calendar sync maintains accuracy with updates within 15 minutes of scheduling
- [ ] Integration reliability exceeds 95% uptime across all supported calendar platforms
- [ ] Privacy protection consistently maintained with no unauthorized access to detailed calendar information

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: Organizer checks availability for 6 team members, finds optimal time, and creates lunch event automatically
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Initial lunch time conflicts with multiple meetings, system suggests alternatives successfully
3. **Mixed Platforms**: Team uses different calendar systems (Google, Outlook, Apple), integration works uniformly
4. **Permission Management**: User revokes calendar access, system handles gracefully with manual fallback options

## Dependencies & Constraints

### Prerequisites
