# Invitation & RSVP System - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: High

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Team lunch coordination fails without reliable invitation delivery and response tracking. Manual coordination via email or messaging leads to missed invitations, unclear attendance, and last-minute confusion about who's attending.

### Solution Overview
We're building a comprehensive invitation system with multi-channel delivery, real-time RSVP tracking, automated reminders, and seamless integration with calendar systems to ensure all team members receive invitations and coordinators have clear attendance visibility.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 95% invitation delivery rate with 80% RSVP response rate within 24 hours
**User Success**: Team members never miss lunch invitations and organizers always know final attendance before restaurant selection

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Invitation Sending** ‚Üí Organizer creates event ‚Üí System sends invitations via preferred channels ‚Üí Team members receive immediate notification
2. **RSVP Response** ‚Üí Team member reviews invitation ‚Üí System provides quick response options ‚Üí Organizer sees real-time attendance updates
3. **Status Tracking** ‚Üí System tracks responses ‚Üí All participants see current attendance ‚Üí Organizer makes informed decisions

**Key User Stories:**
- **As an organizer**, I want to send invitations efficiently so that all team members are informed and can respond easily
- **As a team member**, I want to RSVP quickly so that organizers know my attendance without lengthy processes

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Multi-Channel Invitation Delivery**: Email, push notifications, and SMS with intelligent channel selection based on user preferences
- **Quick RSVP Interface**: One-tap Accept/Decline/Maybe responses with optional reason capture for declines
- **Real-Time Status Updates**: Live attendance tracking with WebSocket updates across all participant devices
- **Automated Reminder System**: Smart reminder timing based on event urgency and user response patterns

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Calendar Integration**: Automatic calendar event creation for accepted invitations with conflict detection
- **Decline Reason Analytics**: Aggregate feedback on common decline reasons for event optimization
- **Group RSVP Management**: Bulk invitation sending and response tracking for recurring team groups

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Focus on invitation/response, not complex schedule optimization
- **Guest Invitations**: Team members only, not external guest management

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Response Deadline**: RSVP responses required 2 hours before lunch time for restaurant planning
- **Default Response**: No response treated as "Maybe" with automatic reminder escalation
- **Change Permission**: Organizer can modify event details until 1 hour before lunch time
- **Cancellation Handling**: Event cancellation triggers immediate notification to all participants

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Late Responses**: When RSVP received after deadline ‚Üí **Expected Behavior**: Accept response but flag as "last minute" for organizer
- **Invitation Delivery Failure**: When primary channel fails ‚Üí **User Experience**: Automatic fallback to secondary channels with delivery confirmation

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **Invitation Cards**: Clear event information with prominent RSVP buttons and event details summary
- **Response Options**: Simple Accept/Decline/Maybe buttons with optional quick reason selection for declines
- **Status Dashboard**: Real-time attendance view showing confirmed, declined, and pending responses
- **Reminder Management**: Automatic reminder delivery with user control over reminder frequency and timing

### User Experience Considerations
- **Quick Response**: RSVP completion in under 10 seconds with minimal required information
- **Status Transparency**: All participants can see current attendance without revealing individual responses unnecessarily
- **Change Accommodation**: Easy response modification with notification to organizer of changes
- **Mobile Optimization**: Full invitation and RSVP functionality optimized for mobile interruption handling

### Accessibility & Usability
- **Invitation Accessibility**: All invitation content accessible via screen readers with clear action options
- **Response Clarity**: RSVP options clearly labeled with confirmation feedback for submitted responses
- **Alternative Channels**: Email and SMS backup ensure invitation delivery regardless of app usage

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

- **Invitation Details**: Event information, participant lists, delivery timestamps, and channel preferences
- **Response Data**: RSVP status, response timing, decline reasons, and change history
- **Delivery Tracking**: Invitation send status, delivery confirmation, and read receipts across channels
- **Engagement Metrics**: Response rates, timing patterns, and channel effectiveness analytics

**Data Display:**
- **Invitation Status**: Delivery confirmation, read status, and response tracking for organizers
- **Attendance Overview**: Current RSVP summary with participant names and response status
- **Response History**: Timeline of RSVP changes with timestamps and reason tracking
- **Reminder Schedule**: Upcoming reminder delivery with user control over timing and content

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: User profiles, calendar systems, and restaurant selection workflow
- **Updates**: Event attendance counts, participant availability, and coordination status
- **Creates**: Attendance confirmations, reminder schedules, and coordination analytics

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: Lunch Event Creation (FT-003), Calendar Integration (FT-006), Real-time Notifications (FT-016)
**Dependencies**: Multi-channel notification infrastructure and real-time update systems
**Impacts**: Drives restaurant selection decisions and final lunch coordination

### Security & Privacy
- **Invitation Privacy**: Event details visible only to invited participants with appropriate access controls
- **Response Confidentiality**: Individual RSVP responses protected while allowing aggregate attendance visibility
- **Delivery Security**: All invitation channels use secure transmission with delivery verification
