# Mobile App Optimization - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P1-High | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Team lunch coordination primarily happens on mobile devices during busy work schedules, but many features are not optimized for mobile use. Poor mobile experience leads to coordination failures and user abandonment during critical lunch planning moments.

### Solution Overview
We're implementing comprehensive mobile optimization including responsive design, touch-friendly interfaces, offline capability for core features, and native mobile integrations to ensure seamless lunch coordination on smartphones and tablets.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 90% of lunch coordination happens on mobile with 95% task completion rate
**User Success**: All lunch coordination features work flawlessly on mobile devices with faster completion times than desktop

## What We're Building
