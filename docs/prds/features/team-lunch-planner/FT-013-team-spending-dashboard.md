# Team Spending Dashboard - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P1-High | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Teams lack visibility into their collective lunch spending patterns, making it difficult to plan budgets, understand dining trends, and make informed decisions about team meal frequency and restaurant choices.

### Solution Overview
We're building a comprehensive team spending analytics dashboard that visualizes lunch expenses, identifies spending patterns, tracks budget utilization, and provides insights to help teams make better dining decisions.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 60% of teams regularly review spending data leading to 25% more informed budget planning
**User Success**: Team managers can understand spending patterns and make data-driven decisions about team lunch policies

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Dashboard Access** ‚Üí User opens team analytics ‚Üí System displays current spending overview with key metrics and trends
2. **Data Exploration** ‚Üí User explores different time periods and categories ‚Üí System provides detailed breakdowns and pattern insights
3. **Insight Application** ‚Üí User identifies optimization opportunities ‚Üí System provides actionable recommendations for budget management

**Key User Stories:**
- **As a team manager**, I want to see spending patterns so that I can plan lunch budgets effectively and understand team dining preferences
- **As a team member**, I want spending transparency so that I can make informed decisions about lunch participation and costs

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Spending Overview Dashboard**: Current month spending with comparisons to previous periods and budget targets
- **Time Period Analysis**: Monthly, quarterly, and yearly spending breakdowns with trend visualization
- **Restaurant and Category Breakdown**: Spending distribution by venue, cuisine type, and meal frequency
