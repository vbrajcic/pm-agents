# User Profile & Preferences - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P1-High | **Complexity Estimate**: Low

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Team lunch coordination requires understanding individual dietary restrictions, budget preferences, and cuisine choices to make suitable restaurant recommendations. Without comprehensive user profiles, lunch planning becomes inefficient and excludes team members with specific needs.

### Solution Overview
We're building a comprehensive user profile system that captures dietary preferences, budget constraints, notification settings, and accessibility requirements to enable personalized lunch coordination and inclusive team dining experiences.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 90% of users complete preference setup leading to 70% more relevant restaurant recommendations
**User Success**: Users receive lunch suggestions that consistently match their dietary needs and budget comfort zone

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Profile Setup** ‚Üí User completes preference configuration ‚Üí System saves settings and provides recommendation preview
2. **Preference Management** ‚Üí User updates dietary/budget changes ‚Üí System immediately applies to future recommendations
3. **Team Integration** ‚Üí User preferences inform group planning ‚Üí System balances individual needs with group coordination

**Key User Stories:**
- **As a user with dietary restrictions**, I want to set my preferences so that restaurant suggestions always accommodate my needs
- **As a budget-conscious team member**, I want to set spending limits so that lunch suggestions stay within my comfortable range

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Dietary Restriction Management**: Comprehensive allergy and dietary preference tracking (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
- **Budget Preference Controls**: Per-meal spending ranges with tip/tax inclusion and currency formatting
- **Cuisine Preferences**: Favorite and disliked cuisine types with intensity ratings for recommendation weighting
- **Notification Preferences**: Granular control over communication timing, channels, and frequency

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Accessibility Settings**: Mobility requirements, seating preferences, and restaurant accessibility needs
- **Social Preferences**: Team interaction style, group size comfort, and lunch frequency preferences
- **Location Preferences**: Preferred distance from office, transportation methods, and neighborhood preferences

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Medical Information**: Focus on dining preferences, not detailed medical/health data
- **Financial Account Integration**: Preference-based budgeting only, not actual payment account linking

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Preference Hierarchy**: Safety restrictions (allergies) override taste preferences, accessibility needs are absolute requirements
- **Budget Validation**: Budget ranges must be realistic for target restaurant categories ($5-$100 per meal)
- **Update Propagation**: Preference changes apply immediately to pending lunch events and future recommendations
- **Privacy Controls**: Users control which preferences are visible to team members vs. system-only

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Conflicting Preferences**: When dietary and cuisine preferences conflict ‚Üí **Expected Behavior**: Prioritize safety restrictions with alternative suggestions
- **Budget Extremes**: When budget too high/low for area ‚Üí **User Experience**: Provide realistic range guidance with local market context
