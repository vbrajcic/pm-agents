# Lunch Event Creation - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Team lunch coordination requires structured event planning that captures all necessary details including timing, participants, preferences, and budget constraints. Without a systematic approach, lunch planning becomes chaotic and excludes team members.

### Solution Overview
We're building a comprehensive lunch event creation system with guided workflows for setting date/time, selecting team members, establishing budget parameters, and capturing dietary preferences to ensure successful group coordination.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 90% of created events result in confirmed restaurant selection and successful lunch coordination
**User Success**: Event organizers can set up complete lunch plans in under 3 minutes with all necessary participant information

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Event Initiation** ‚Üí User starts new lunch event ‚Üí System opens guided creation wizard with smart defaults
2. **Parameter Setting** ‚Üí User configures timing, team, budget, preferences ‚Üí System validates and suggests optimizations
3. **Event Finalization** ‚Üí User reviews complete event details ‚Üí System creates event and triggers invitation flow

**Key User Stories:**
- **As a team organizer**, I want to create lunch events systematically so that I can coordinate with my team efficiently
- **As a budget-conscious planner**, I want to set spending constraints so that restaurant suggestions fit everyone's comfort zone

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Multi-Step Event Wizard**: Guided form with validation, progress indicators, and smart defaults based on team history
- **Date/Time Selection**: Calendar integration with conflict detection and optimal time suggestions
- **Team Member Selection**: Multi-select participant list with role indicators and dietary preference display
- **Budget Range Controls**: Per-person and total budget sliders with currency formatting and tax/tip estimation

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Template System**: Save and reuse common event configurations for regular team gatherings
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI-powered recommendations for timing, participants, and budget based on past successful events
- **Draft Management**: Save incomplete events as drafts with resume capability

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Focus on simple date/time selection, not complex scheduling optimization
- **Budget Splitting**: Event creation sets budget constraints; actual splitting happens post-meal

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Minimum Participants**: Events require at least 2 participants including organizer for valid creation
- **Timing Constraints**: Events can be scheduled 1 hour to 30 days in advance with business hour defaults
- **Budget Validation**: Per-person budget must be realistic for target restaurant category ($10-$200 range)
- **Preference Aggregation**: System consolidates dietary restrictions and cuisine preferences from all participants

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Scheduling Conflicts**: When selected time conflicts with participant calendars ‚Üí **Expected Behavior**: Show conflicts with alternative time suggestions
- **Budget Mismatch**: When budget too low for participant preferences ‚Üí **User Experience**: Suggest budget adjustment or preference modification

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **Creation Wizard**: Step-by-step interface with clear progress indicators and validation feedback
- **Calendar Component**: Interactive date/time picker with visual conflict indicators and suggestion highlights
- **Participant Selector**: Visual team member cards with photos, dietary indicators, and selection status
- **Budget Interface**: Intuitive sliders with real-time calculation of total costs and per-person amounts

### User Experience Considerations
- **Quick Creation**: Common event types can be created in under 3 minutes with minimal required fields
- **Smart Defaults**: System suggests reasonable defaults based on team history and current context
- **Error Prevention**: Validation prevents invalid combinations before user proceeds to next step
- **Mobile Optimization**: Full creation workflow optimized for mobile use during busy work environments

### Accessibility & Usability
- **Form Accessibility**: All creation steps work with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Clear Labels**: Budget amounts and participant selections clearly labeled for accessibility
- **Touch Optimization**: Mobile interface elements sized appropriately for touch interaction

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **Event Parameters**: Date, time, location, participant list, budget range, and dietary considerations
- **Team Information**: Participant profiles, dietary restrictions, budget preferences, and calendar availability
- **Historical Data**: Past event success rates, preferred timing patterns, and budget effectiveness
- **Template Data**: Saved event configurations with usage frequency and customization patterns

**Data Display:**
- **Event Summary**: Complete event overview with all parameters clearly presented for confirmation
- **Participant Overview**: Team member list with dietary indicators, availability status, and contact information
- **Budget Breakdown**: Cost estimates including per-person amounts, tax, tip, and total event budget
- **Template Gallery**: Saved configurations with usage history and customization options

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: User profiles, calendar systems, and restaurant recommendation engine
- **Updates**: Team coordination patterns, budget effectiveness tracking, and preference learning
- **Creates**: Event records, participant notification triggers, and coordination workflow initiation

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: User Profile & Preferences (FT-002), Calendar Integration (FT-006), Restaurant Recommendations (FT-005)
**Dependencies**: Calendar access permissions and team member profile data
**Impacts**: Triggers invitation system and influences restaurant recommendation parameters

### Security & Privacy
- **Event Privacy**: Event details visible only to invited participants with appropriate access controls
- **Calendar Security**: Calendar integration uses secure OAuth with minimal permission scope
- **Budget Privacy**: Individual budget preferences protected while allowing group coordination

## Acceptance Criteria

### Feature Complete When:
**Core Functionality:**
- [ ] Events can be created with all required fields validated and properly formatted
- [ ] Date/time selection prevents conflicts and suggests optimal coordination windows
- [ ] Participant selection handles team dynamics with dietary and preference integration
- [ ] Budget controls provide realistic constraints that enable successful restaurant recommendations

**User Experience:**
- [ ] Event creation wizard is intuitive enough to complete without training or help documentation
- [ ] Mobile creation workflow works seamlessly for busy professionals during work hours
