# Real-time Notification System - Feature PRD

**Priority**: P0-Critical | **Complexity Estimate**: Medium

## Purpose & Context

### Problem Statement
Team lunch coordination requires timely communication to keep all participants informed about invitations, updates, confirmations, and changes. Without reliable real-time notifications, team members miss important updates and lunch coordination fails.

### Solution Overview
We're building a comprehensive notification system that delivers immediate updates through multiple channels, respects user preferences, and maintains real-time synchronization across all devices to ensure no team member misses critical lunch coordination information.

### Success Criteria
**Business Success**: 95% notification delivery rate with <5% missed lunch events due to communication failures
**User Success**: Team members receive immediate, relevant notifications and can control their communication preferences completely

## What We're Building

### Core User Experience

**Primary User Flow:**
1. **Event Trigger** → System detects coordination event → System determines relevant participants and notification type
2. **Delivery Processing** → System sends via user's preferred channels → User receives immediate notification with action options
3. **Response Handling** → User interacts with notification → System updates all participants in real-time

**Key User Stories:**
- **As a team member**, I want immediate notifications so that I don't miss lunch invitations or important updates
- **As someone managing notification overload**, I want to control notification types so that I'm informed but not overwhelmed

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have (Core Functionality):**
- **Multi-Channel Delivery**: Push notifications, email, and SMS with intelligent fallback when primary channels fail
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket-based instant delivery with offline queuing and batch delivery on reconnect
- **Granular Preferences**: Individual control over notification types, timing, channels, and frequency
- **Interactive Notifications**: Quick actions (Accept/Decline RSVP, View Details) directly from notification interface

**Should Have (Important but not blocking):**
- **Smart Timing**: Notification scheduling based on user time zones, work hours, and do-not-disturb preferences
- **Notification Grouping**: Bundle related updates to reduce notification fatigue while maintaining urgency
- **Delivery Confirmation**: Read receipts and delivery status for critical coordination messages

**Won't Have (Out of scope):**
- **Voice Notifications**: Focus on text-based channels for initial implementation
- **Advanced AI Filtering**: Simple preference-based filtering rather than machine learning personalization

### Business Rules & Logic

**Core Business Rules:**
- **Delivery Priority**: Lunch invitations highest priority, updates medium, reminders low with appropriate delivery urgency
- **Channel Fallback**: If push notification fails, automatically attempt email, then SMS for critical messages
- **Timing Respect**: Honor do-not-disturb hours except for same-day urgent coordination needs
- **Batch Prevention**: Critical lunch coordination notifications sent immediately, non-critical batched hourly

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- **Device Offline**: When user device unavailable → **Expected Behavior**: Queue notifications and deliver batch on reconnection
- **Channel Failure**: When notification service down → **User Experience**: Automatic fallback to alternative channels with status tracking

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Requirements
- **Notification Cards**: Clear, actionable notifications with essential information and quick response options
- **Preference Management**: Comprehensive settings for channels, types, timing, and frequency control
- **Notification History**: Archive of all received notifications with search and filter capabilities
- **Status Indicators**: Clear delivery and read status for sent coordination messages

### User Experience Considerations
- **Immediate Clarity**: Notifications contain all essential information without requiring app opening
- **Action Efficiency**: Most common responses (RSVP, payment confirmation) available directly from notification
- **Noise Reduction**: Smart filtering prevents overwhelming users while ensuring critical messages reach everyone
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Notification status synchronized across mobile, desktop, and web platforms

### Accessibility & Usability
- **Notification Accessibility**: All notifications work with screen readers and assistive technology
- **Visual Indicators**: Notification importance and type indicated through multiple visual cues
- **Alternative Channels**: Email and SMS options ensure accessibility for users with hearing or visual impairments

## Data & Integration

### Data Requirements

**Data Collection:**
- **User Preferences**: Channel selections, timing preferences, notification type controls, and do-not-disturb settings
- **Delivery Tracking**: Notification send times, delivery confirmation, read status, and response actions
- **Event Context**: Lunch coordination context, participant lists, and urgency levels for intelligent routing
- **Performance Metrics**: Delivery success rates, response times, and user engagement with notifications

**Data Display:**
- **Preference Dashboard**: Complete notification control interface with preview capabilities
- **Notification Feed**: Chronological list of all notifications with status and action history
- **Delivery Status**: Real-time tracking of notification delivery for coordination organizers
- **Performance Analytics**: System reliability metrics and user satisfaction with notification experience

**Data Relationships:**
- **Connects To**: All coordination features requiring user communication and updates
- **Updates**: User engagement patterns, notification effectiveness, and delivery optimization
- **Creates**: Communication audit trail, user preference analytics, and system performance data

### Integration Points
**Connects With**: All team coordination features (invitations, updates, payments, confirmations)
**Dependencies**: Push notification services, email providers, SMS gateways, and WebSocket infrastructure
**Impacts**: Critical infrastructure enabling all team coordination and communication features

### Security & Privacy
- **Message Security**: All notification content encrypted in transit with secure delivery confirmation
- **Privacy Controls**: Users control what information appears in notifications and who can send them
- **Data Protection**: Notification history and preferences protected with same standards as core user data

## Acceptance Criteria

### Feature Complete When:
**Core Functionality:**
- [ ] Notifications deliver within 5 seconds for real-time coordination needs
- [ ] Multi-channel fallback ensures 99%+ delivery rate for critical lunch coordination
- [ ] User preferences respected consistently across all notification types and channels
- [ ] Interactive notifications enable quick responses without opening main application

**User Experience:**
- [ ] Notification content provides sufficient information for immediate decision-making
- [ ] Preference management gives users complete control without overwhelming complexity
- [ ] Cross-device synchronization ensures consistent experience regardless of platform
- [ ] Notification volume feels appropriate and valuable rather than intrusive

**Quality Standards:**
- [ ] Delivery reliability maintained even during peak usage and system load
- [ ] Notification performance doesn't impact main application responsiveness
- [ ] Privacy and security maintained throughout all notification channels and storage

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: User receives lunch invitation immediately, responds via notification, and all participants updated in real-time
2. **Channel Failure**: Push notification service fails, system automatically delivers via email within seconds
3. **Preference Respect**: User with restricted notification hours receives urgent same-day coordination appropriately
4. **Multi-Device**: User sees notification on phone, marks as read, and status updates across all devices immediately

## Dependencies & Constraints

### Prerequisites
- **Notification Services**: Push notification platform (Firebase/OneSignal), email service, and SMS gateway
