### Question Examples

**For Missing Success Metrics**:
```
"I need to understand how you'll measure success for the Analytics Dashboard.
Will you track:

1) User Adoption Rate - % of team actively using system within 90 days
2) Operational Efficiency - Time/cost savings from automated reporting
3) Business Impact - Revenue influenced by data-driven decisions
4) All of the above - Comprehensive success measurement

This affects how we define success criteria and measurement approach."
```

**For Missing Timeline**:
```
"What's driving the timeline for the Employee Onboarding Portal?

1) Hard Deadline - Specific date due to external commitment (please specify)
2) Soft Target - Preferred timeframe but flexible (e.g., "Q2 2024")
3) Competitive Pressure - Market window or competitive threat
4) Flexible Timeline - Quality over speed, no specific deadline

This affects phase planning, resource allocation, and MVP scope."
```

**For Missing Technical Requirements**:
```
"For the Inventory Management System, are there any required technologies
or technical constraints?

1) Must Integrate - Specific systems we must connect to (please list)
2) Technology Standards - Company standards we must follow (e.g., React, AWS)
3) Security/Compliance - Regulatory requirements (e.g., SOC2, GDPR)
4) Complete Flexibility - No technical constraints, choose best approach

This affects architecture decisions and implementation strategy."
```

### Completeness Assessment

After generation, the interactive agent provides:

```markdown
## Information Completeness

### Context Gathered
✅ **From Transcript**: Feature requirements (excellent detail), user workflows
   (comprehensive), stakeholder perspectives (3 groups identified)

✅ **From Q&A Session**: Success metrics (quantified targets), timeline
   (hard deadline identified), technical constraints (integration requirements),
   team capacity (resource allocation defined)

✅ **PRD Completeness**: 95% - Ready for feature extraction

### Remaining Open Items

**Non-Critical Items** (can be addressed during implementation):
- [ ] Specific vendor selection for payment processing (3 options under evaluation)
- [ ] Final design system decision (Material UI vs custom components)
- [ ] Beta user selection criteria (to be defined in Phase 1)

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Stakeholder review of success metrics and timeline
2. Technical architecture validation with engineering lead
3. Proceed with feature extraction once approved
```
