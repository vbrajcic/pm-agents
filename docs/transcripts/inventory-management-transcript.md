E Anita. So that you have a difference between the user of the subscription and the accounting of your company. So then Anita receives emails for OpenAI directly, and you don't even have to do anything.

So it literally depends from platform to platform, and that's why it cannot be scaled as such. But does that make sense to have some I'm not sure if it can be an email or we can, like, do invoice at Propheco hire HR to send basically all the emails. Some system will get all the invoicing and then just Yes. If you're able to if if the tool you're using supports sending emails to a different accounting address, but a lot of them don't. Emails can be forwarded automatically.

That's the easiest fix. But you can you can, yeah, sign it for on your email and then just send it make a automatic forward when from this one, I'll send it to the invoice. And I meant it in Gmail. You set you set up a forwarding rule if you just forward all the all the invoices there. Okay.

But I think we're overcomplicating it, like I said. The problem we're trying to solve with this is just one, is who do I need to talk to about this subscription? So I've looked at our accounting sent me what they do, they send you a list of transactions. They they're saying, okay. For the ones marked in yellow, we don't have any proof of payment.

There's no, like, physical invoice. And sometimes it's like a hotel in Oslo I stayed in, and I forgot to take the business invoice. So I had to send an email to a hotel. Hey, I stayed there. Blah blah.

Can you please send me an invoice for this? And then we literally go one by one, and we try to remove them. And sometimes it says, CHET GPT, I don't know, something something, $20, and it's like six times in a row. And you're not able to identify who has CHET GPT under my company card at the company. And then I had to create a table and say, okay, I know that you have that you have that this guy has for cursor or whatever, and then I'm able to pick them to send me the invoice.

And when I talk to them and say, okay, guys, please ensure you store all the invoices that we're gonna need. So the issue here is just finding who does this certain subscription belong to. That's it. But then And the second one is to keep track of people that are having that have bought something for work using their own account so that we're able to reimburse them. Those are the two issues.

No fancy integration, no APIs to Stripe, no approval rejection, just the log. We don't the user don't even have to request it. I'll do everything manually because my card is the one that's the biggest hooker in profit card. It just goes from person to person. But they can request it.

Why not? No. I will What do you mean by not request? What not? No.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             r a message.

That's also a hassle. It's the same thing, and we have a system we're building. Let's put everything through that flow. Okay. Okay.

But I wanted to you ask But let's let's back like, can we just talk about how does entering the subscription look like? So what kind of we we need an information. So when I try to create a new subscription, So I had to give it the name. I have to give it the price. I have to give it the frequency, whether it's, like, monthly or yearly.

I have to see what how it was paid, whether it was company card or somebody's personal card. I have to see whether it includes the invoice includes company data or not, and who's the person receiving the invoice. I would also add the invoice as a file, like, required thing to upload when you do that. Yeah. But some are monthly.

Right? So you'll probably have a reminder that, you know, you you have not submitted invoice. Oh, if we could do that, I will be That's that's why I'm thinking about invoicing at Propheco, and you just Oh,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             we're we're saying all this gets it from the email. It's not easy because sometimes you just get an email that your subscription has been renewed, and then you need to go into link and log in into your account and then download the PDF. For example, that's the data came from me.

No. No. You don't get the account invoice on email? No. It just says your subscription has been renewed blah blah linked to your account and then you have Yes.

We don't need to set up auto forwarding. But what would be really great is that I know that Philip is the owner of this subscription. It's monthly. Philip needs to upload 12 invoices for that month for that subscription. If we could do that, that's amazing because that avoids all the issues of ping ponging and calling Philip and asking him and the system can remind him and he just that's perfect.

The only thing is, for instance, Eric, in in his case, in which he bought something with his personal card, but but it's being reimbursed, he doesn't have to upload any invoice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             So it's less be able to cancel it. So and Anita needs to get that information so that she stops ringing. Okay. Yes.

But yes. But we let's let's put that as, like Is there maybe an sorry to interrupt, but option for an auto renewal or something, so we should kind of keep track of those. So, mean, if it's paid yearly and if you kind of go into the next year or you don't want to, should we kind of get a plan? This will be auto renewed now. Do you still want it?

Or No. I don't think so. Because usually, what was pro probably gonna happen is at the end of the year when we are doing these inventory checkups, we're gonna have a subscription checkup, and people are gonna be able to tell. And let's let's put it this way, our people are how how to say it? Responsible enough that they take care about which subscriptions are used or not.

So for instance, Nikola tries a lot of probably is probably the power user of most subscriptions of the company. You will telling me, we don't need anymore. We don't need Zeppelin a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            nymore. We don't need this. We don't need that.

So people are quite conscious about some of most of them, let's put it this way. But we're gonna do, an inventory checkup because today, we don't even know which subscriptions we pay or nothing. We have the system. Somebody can log in, especially trust me, Mattel will be the one logging in and checking and killing the subscription. So I'm not sure if it's overcomplicating, but subscriptions can have monthly and yearly plan.

For example, we have Figma, and now on Figma, we have some kind of mixed Yes. People of 12 people on monthly plan and 10 on yearly. The price is a little bit different. Also, in some cases, when I were requesting for something, the management should decide are we going to one time yearly payment or monthly, which is more expensive. So do we need also to maybe somehow write it or divide each field for year monthly or something like that just so you can get sense two, like, two Figma subscriptions in my mind.

One that's paid yearly, the ot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            her one that's paid But when I'm requesting a pro product and writing about pricing, should I write you monthly plan and yearly plan so you are aware Yes. So all the forms so all the reading that could make an impact. But they are ringing decision. It's 30% No. I can I can tell you this way?

Most of subscriptions the are gonna be requested monthly because we are trying to test them out to see if they work. But whenever we are paying a subscription on a yearly basis like our Google Workspace account or our, I don't know, What was the other one? Harvest, for instance, those are the tools that you know you're gonna use throughout in the absence, for instance. You know that you're gonna use them throughout the year. So let's put it, like, monthly as the default one, and then you're on you don't have to provide both.

If you see a limitation that you can provide one, you will to knock on my door and say, hey. We're looking to this, and we're gonna handle it outside of the system. Anything else about subscriptio                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ns? No. Then we can pause the recording.

Do we need

We don't need the formal of, like, that is similar we have in equipment because Why not? Why not? These are smaller transactions that just get auto approved, and the biggest hassle with this is me literally giving somebody a card to do it. Yeah. But it's also a hassle finding you and getting you to answeasy. Easy. Easy. We are trying to build an internal product that's supposed to help us with tracking the all the equipment that we have at the company, including the subscriptions. The issues that we currently have is that we're not able to tell which laptop belongs to who, what's the year of that laptop, where we need to plan budgets for next year, we don't understand which laptops require changing, everything is done seldomly, people are unable to request new equipment.

Sometimes we buy equipment in one go. Sometimes we buy it through leasing. Sometimes we buy it through EU funds. And then you need to know which serial number was purchased by which method because you need it for your own accounting and reporting. And then after they end up, like, a buyout cycle in in leasing, you have to use basically your own property.

You don't have to keep it on your books anymore. So what we're trying to do is we're trying to build a system in which everybody can submit their own equipment, request new equipment. We can see who who currently possesses what part of the equipment. And I don't know. Apart from that, those these are all physical devices like laptops, monitors, mobile phones, test devices, and I don't know.

And then the second part is the software licenses, which sometimes people buy subscriptions for something using their own card, then we reimburse them through bonuses, or sometimes I'm the one buying subscriptions for them, and then they need to report back to me with company invoice and data. The issue we have with that is sometimes my company card is used by too many people. And then at the end of the year, when we try to close all the accounting reports, some of the bills are missing. And I'm not able to trace back, okay, this is subscription for Philip. I should talk to Philip about it.

So that's the product in a dutch. Where do we start? Is this what you wanted, Siddish? Yeah. Something like that.

I was I thought you asked him where to start. No. No. No. It's the the AI is currently just recording what we're discussing.

How did you handle equipment until now? Until now, we had a Google form in which everybody had to input their own equipment. What then we have to what was it called? The like that? Or Yes.

We had a I'm getting there. So, initially, we had a Google form in which you had to type in your serial number, the year. You you you guys filled it out. You know? So we were asking basic information about the equipment, but it was Google Forms.

So nesting the questions and form was quite tedious because, usually, you want to end up with, you know, a single row in the database per single item. In this case, I had to, like, do some scripts to decouple those form results into a Google Sheet, and then we would kept it in that Google Sheet. But the issue was also that it we just had a list of all of all the equipment. It was difficult to pivot. So when I click on Bruno to see, you know, what what's all the equipment that Bruno has, and we were missing this some metadata that Tony, Matteo, and I know because we're the only ones that know whether we were bought that equipment through leasing or whether it was direct payment to the vendor or, you know, stuff like that.

So it was Google Sheet, and then we pivoted to, like, a sub hosted solution for this, like an open source. But that's too complex, and it's not ideal for our case because it just has too many options, too many configurations. It has no, like, user profile. It's difficult to share access to people, and it's difficult to maintain. Yeah.

That's what I wanted to ask. So you have multiple levels of access, someone that will input the data, someone that will that will read the data, not everyone can see all the data and so on. So that that should be a big part of of the product, I guess? Yes. In terms of user role, so we have, like, let's say, a regular user that should be only able to do two things.

One is they should be able to provide their own data. So this is the equipment that I have. This is my serial number for my device, blah blah, all the information about the devices that I have. And then second one would be to request new equipment. Like, for instance, I don't know, Bruno had a slow laptop before, and then the process was that he would reach out to Philip, then Philip would let me know, and then I would forget about it, then I would ask Anita to order it.

In a typical case, Bruno just creates a request. Hey. I need a laptop with this, this, and the configuration. And then somebody with a higher role has the ability to approve or reject, and then in case or approve it, it gets ordered in case it rejects. So let's say keeping track of your own equipment and requesting new equipment.

That that's the kinda most basic. But, obviously, there are now there's a flow of orders and approvals and so on. So not just Yes. And then you have somebody with, like, a team lead role that should be able to see all of the equipment for their team members. So, like, a manager role, let's put it that way.

That And manager can obviously approve or reject request for their own team members and can see all the equipment that their team members have. And then the last one would be somebody, like, on an admin level that has access to everything and can see the data about everybody and edit and do whatever. Same total payrolls? Yes. Or yes.

Yes. How and who appoints a role to I mean, somebody that sets up the organization. I mean, when you look at profit, I would probably be the one inviting all the users, giving them roles, creating relations between managers and team members. Yes. Does it work through an invite system?

So So you create an invitation and you invite people, or can you request to join? How does it work? I think it works through the invitation. It's gonna be a process of, like, standard onboarding like you do when you get to a company. So when somebody creates your absence account, your harvest account, the third step would be to create your inventory account and enter there.

The only sorry. One thing that I mentioned is a big challenge happens when you switch devices. So oftentimes, for instance, we had a situation in which I bought a new device for Kola, and then Kola took his new device and handed over his old device to Beta. But in our current system, that serial number for your device is still I mean under you. So we need an option to check out device and assign it to somebody else.

Who does that part? The is is that done by the user who is having the older device or the manager? It depends. So sometimes I would receive that laptop. You see that I have, like, six MacBooks on my shelf in my office, and then it would be great that these MacBooks are, like, part of our inventory that's currently available.

So a typical case would be when I hand over you that laptop. In the process of handing it over, it gets assigned to the person that I'm giving this laptop to. Or in your case, when you're switching, you should simply, like, assign to your existing laptop and you take the new one. You know, should he be able to to approve or disprove this let's say, I assign it to to Petter, but I I gave it to Petter by mistake, and then it's system technically it's on him, but it's actually on me. So should he be able to say, okay.

I I agree. You gave to him. It would be now that you mentioned it, it would be, like, extremely elegant if all of this happens when you log in so that when, let's say, Bruno logs into this app, that we immediately fetch all the the for instance, for laptop, the device information about I'm not sure if this is retrievable, if, like, license serial number is identifiable information by the site. We can decide. I mean, we are the ones doing it, so it can be a yes.

Maybe too specific of a question. What does if if you cannot think of a piece of equipment as as an entity in, I don't know, in a process, does anything change other than who's the owner? You mentioned this leasing thing, some Okay. Yes. Accounting stuff and so on.

Is it relevant for this product or not? In in this flow, what happens, a new laptop comes in. So I'm the one usually receiving the equipment. So somebody with the admin role logs in, and then I add a new device. I type in its serial number, I type in all the configuration, which type for instance MacBook Pro m three two thousand twenty three with six twenty four gigas, gigabytes of RAM and so on.

And then at that point, I already know what was the method of purchasing this laptop, whether it was like directly, how how to say it, debit payment to the vendor or whether it was to Zopi or whether it was through Lizzie. So Mateo and I are probably the only two people in the company that are aware of this information and and kind of manage it. And the only reason why we need it is sometimes when accounting ask us, okay, please send us your inventory. Some laptops are not shown in this inventory because they were purchased through Zopi, and then we don't have to report anything. Some laptops, after two years of amortization because it does the also big big important part is when did you purchase the laptop because you're responsible to have it for at least two years, and then it's like leftover value is zero, I mean, accounting wise.

And then we're able to purchase them out. And what we're currently doing, we are purchasing them out by our own money because it then needs kind of the laptop piece of the books, and then you no longer have to keep inventory because it was sold to Mateo. And then we reimburse Mateo for for making that transaction. So that's one way to kinda keep the books. But that will also be part of this Yes.

Combination? Part of this is when you so when you enter it in the system, you need to enter the start date of let's call it start date for this device. And then the only important information is that you're aware, like, you how much time has passed until it hits the two year window. And you will be or you will need to make reports for this accounting purposes, like which equipment do we Yes. I'll I'll try to some kind of reporting based on based on different I'll try to find Filip, go ahead.

I'll try to find how we handle that because I I used, like, classification of Yeah. The assets. It doesn't have to I mean, we don't have to go into details, but this would be a kind of a module in this application or or not, basically? Yeah. It has to be.

So the way I see it is literally just like a tag that should be configured by an admin so the admin can assign a tag for every equipment, and it should be like a predetermined set of tags. So we can put it like Profico, Zopi, or leasing. And then PROFICO mean that which is like the equipment owned by us. ZOPI is something that we bought under this initiative with Croatian government. And then the third one is that it was leased.

And then the fourth one can be, I don't know, off the shelf. Let's put it that way. So all all of the equipment that we have can fall into these categories. That's speaking about the hardware when it comes to soft software parts. So the biggest differentiation between the two is I think we have three cases.

So let's talk about the case in which something was bought through the company card. So it was bought through a company just software now? Yes. If it's bought, true. Can I just two things about this hardware?

So one is just suggestion. The other one is a real question. You talked about the accounting asking for a report of devices devices that are being used and how are they paid for. So the app should have a feature or something that ex that they can export a list of devices who would maybe not who they belong to, but when were they purchased? You just need, like, a serial number, and sometimes I can give you, like, an actual case.

Sometimes, like I'm not sure if it's tax inspection or something. It can come in. And then when they go through your books, they're like asking, okay, where's this device? So I need to be able to find the serial number of device who see who this device belongs to. And I'm like, hey, Nicola, could you please bring this device in the next couple of days?

That's, like, the reason why we why we need it. And then we need to know that these that this equipment actually exists. Okay. So you need to be able to export the serial number of the device and who they belong to or why Why do need to export it? He No.

No need to yeah. I need to export it because sometimes they look they usually What's the document? They look like your accounting would ask for, like, PDF or Google or Excel sheet, not Google sheet because And the second one was when you talk about entering the name of the device, serial number, and blah blah blah, all the information about the device, maybe it would be nice to be able to scan the barcode Yes. Or the QR. I was gonna get to that.

So the this open source solution that we used actually had that, and you were able to design your own barcode label. But then we had issues with Matteo not wanting us to have, like, a barcode visible on your device. You've probably seen it if you you work with Ericsson, and you see that all the every part of the equipment is clearly labeled. So we need something that has, like, a QR code or a barcode that we generated by the system. To the case you actually get the MacBook in.

I don't know by heart if it has a barcode or a QR code or something It has. That identifies it. Just scan that, and that maybe has Oh, yes. Yes. All the information for it.

Not not the physical case of the MacBook, rather the case of content and books. I mean, one solution that we opted in is, like, that we could have printed out stickers and then place it at the bottom of your device so that it's not visible. But, yes, because what happens, you have a MacBook that's dead dead with battery, and then you have to boot it just to get the serial number. And then sometimes you're not able to log in, then and it would be nice just to be able to see the serial number. Okay.

This laptop used to belong to Koola, but now it's so we need, like, express check-in, check out of devices. So you need you need a mobile component for the app, which makes sense to make it than a web app. It's easier to What do you You need to be so you have to scan a laptop. You go or you cannot scan it with another laptop. That makes no sense.

So you have to have a phone so you can just Yeah. It makes me a more responsive app. Moment. Okay. Just technical.

Anything else from the hardware part that we need to discuss? What do we think about quality of the products? I know we have, like, a dongles that will malfunction every now and then. So maybe Okay. Yes.

The brand and the model is it That's good. So we have conditioners. Essentially, the only there's, like, a barrier to which equipment needs to be kept on the books, let's say. So everything, I think, at least to my knowledge, is everything above €150 of purchase price needs to be kept in books for two years because it needs to deprecate it over time. Everything under that is considered, like, small small inventory, and you're not obliged to keep any data about that.

But what I would like for us is to be able to for people to request equipment. So when you need a keyboard or when you need a mouse or when you need a dongle or your brake set, are you able to make a request through the system? And then we don't have to add it to serial number or any of that data because a lot of them is completely unnecessary. But we know that, for instance, that it has a D Link HDMI to USB C adapter that's working. And then when it doesn't work, you simply report it as malfunction.

It gets plate removed. It gets admogged somewhere in the system. And for instance, I have 20 dongles in my drawer over there, and then somebody can pick it up. Yeah. But we don't need to label it in any, like, type of fashion.

It's just like can we discuss what's the way what what would be the best way to handle that? What? These dongles. Actually, what you said, I need a dongle. I put a request in for a dongle.

It's a piece of equipment. It it just isn't maybe deprecated over time because it doesn't have to. It doesn't have to have a serial number, but it's still in the books because, you know, we have plenty of them available and you can just Okay. But let's say we can But how do how do do we barcode them? Do we label them?

Maybe just to to copy, I would say. Maybe take a photo that recognizes that it's a USB dongle, and that's it. If we don't need too much information about it. Yeah. I I can tell you.

So the the biggest we have two challenges with these. One is to have requests for ordering them, and then the second one is to understand how much of them we actually have at disposal. So, Mike, I guess the question for you guys would be, these 20 ones that I have in my drawer, do I have to put them in the system, or do I have to and if I do, how do I put them in the system? Maybe maybe just one item with 20 count, then you just kind of give them out. Yeah.

So it doesn't have to be 20 specific same objects because they don't have serial numbers. They don't have anything. It's just Okay. So, basically, we have this let's talk about objects a bit for hardware. So we have equipment type, and equipment type is computer, display, keyboard, mouse, or dongle.

And tablet. Or other. Or other. Let's put let's put it on the other camera. Do we have any other equipment type?

Sorry. Mobile phones and tablets. Right? So that those are like If we count that as maybe Cables are under dongles, this category. Yeah.

People request USB c to USB c. Yes. It's a other type. Okay. Then these equipment types are either used by an individual.

So there's a person that kinda has it or they're part of the shared group. For instance, testing devices don't belong to individuals. Belong to, like, everybody at the company to test out. The issue that we have with test devices is that sometimes you don't know who's using the device. So for instance, we have a Android tablet that's currently used by Lucia.

Lucia took it home, and then Luca needs to test when he found it, and he doesn't even know that the tablet is The old device should belong to somebody to somebody, and, you know, they should send to maybe a group of people. To a group of people, yes, but it doesn't tell you who the person currently using it. Yeah. That's why I said ask me So those items should be accessible for all users in the in the app, and you should be able to essentially tag them as bear with me now. Yes.

That's You you should then do it a couple of times a day. Now it's it's with me. Now it's not with me. Now I'm taking it home. Or maybe if they belong to a group.

I don't know. It's it seems like a out of scope problem to to me. It's the device is basically belong to the company. We can we can maybe label it as a QA testing device so we know it's a QA testing device. And then we just set set a rule that those device scales cannot leave the company.

So if they have to be in the office. And if you need if you need to take it home if you if you need to it's a rule that we can enforce outside of I mean, it will be good to have a face ID that scans whose face use it. But But if you if you need to take a device home, then it maybe makes sense to get that person a device Yes. Exactly. Yeah.

Agree. Yeah, like we said, we have these equipment tags. They belong either to individual or they're like a shared device in the company. That device should have its name, which is the brand and the model, should have a serial number, should have when it was purchased or the date of the purchase, and it should probably have, like I'm not sure now about this information, like, the processing power and RAM and storage, whether it's something If you know something If you can see a number and model, you you have all of that information. But, yeah, it depends.

Okay. Over the system, maybe it or not. I I I would say yes because when let's say, when Bruno makes a request for new equipment, then I can see whether his current configuration has satisfied his needs or he needs something better. But Okay. Let's but let's put it this way so that the we have we're gonna have information that's mandatory.

And then if we have the serial number, we we should be able to pull out, like, the details of the device from an API. Third party API. As well might be useful. Yeah. Sorry?

Pins and passwords for tablets and phones might be useful. For sure. Okay. Okay. Let's let's stick with let's stick with computers for now, and we're gonna go through but I agree with Lukaichi.

So Do we need also to write down work warranty? What do you mean? How long? Okay. Yeah.

It's one year under warranty, but that depends. And that's that's something course. One plus one. Would I think it's an out of scope issue because when damage happens to the laptop, we we will simply look it up. It's not like that we need to keep track of how long it's Yeah.

You can check when it's set as a You literally have, I think, on the the invoice for the device, you have the information about the warranty, how long does it last. Okay. Do we need to have invoices somehow brought into the system linked somewhere? What are the invoices? Oh, that that would be extremely nice.

So that would be, like, really nice nice to have feature because then when a new laptops comes in, I can literally just upload the PDF, and then it will process the device that it arrived. The only issue is that there's a mismatch between the time of when the invoice is created and when the device actually comes into the office because there's, like, a five or seven days delay until they are But you can assign a laptop to someone when someone registers it? Yes. We can have, like, a pending we we should have, like, a pending state in which the device is arriving and then, like, available state, which is devices here, but it's not been Yeah. On on us but it's not assigned to anybody and then, like, assigned.

But apart from that, so you let's say you entered the basic data, which is serial number, year, blah blah, date when it was purchased, maybe purchase price, so everything from the invoice. So a note to our AI will be cool to be able to fetch the information from the invoice itself, Some OCR stuff there. That's for device. Anything else missing or that we will be interesting? Do we need, like, a stock?

Do we have do we need, like, have to have minimal stock amount? For example, dongles. So we all always need to have at least five Yeah. Dongles available. Especially the yes.

For dongles, yes. So for let's put it this way. For all these, like, small inventory type of equipment, yes. One thing that tends to happen is that somebody gets hired and then they come in, let's say, in one month's time. And then we forget about whether we have or don't have a laptop or not laptop, we usually are quite good with, so we pay attention to that part, but display is a good example.

So somebody comes to the company and you forgot to order a display for them. So user journey for that would probably be that you would create a new employee and their start date. And then if the system doesn't have at least one display or one laptop available, they should notify that this person is joining in in seven days and then you need to order the equipment. And should you it's kind of not a big deal, but should you maybe be able to kind of reassign something to someone kind of reserve Yes. For them even though it's not Yes.

Yes. Their property yet. And and kind of on similar note, do we need to keep track of who was the previous owner or something so we can maybe Yes. Get a chain. Yeah.

Yes. Not maybe the whole chain, but at least the last owner. But laptops don't usually, have, like, one or two owners max. So it's not like that you're gonna because every four years, we tend to replay more every three years. And then by that time, it's usually been with one person or maybe two.

And it it takes a limitation difference between one and two owners is a big difference. That's why I said that And just the look the last person most of the scenarios first owner, but More than each one. Can have It's a lookbook. Usually, Hola, you always have one one active. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. User and everything else was, like, logs of who owned it before, and they're just, like, tracking who who used to own it. Okay. So all of the previous users have yeah.

Fuck it. Okay. I have an additional question. I'm I'm I'm not sure how to frame this or which name to call it, but I know we had issues with certain devices before. For example, when you mentioned those dongles, some of them were really bad or went bad after, like, six months.

So maybe it would not be a bad idea to have either a small review system in place or some notes that can be applied to each device. So you say I was actually gonna ask those for MacBooks as well, right, that I will put down the m what what's this? M three here as heats up in Yes. We need we need to have definitely notes, and then notes is one part so that we have, like, some grading system about what's the quality of the equipment, like, how would you rate it, and notes if you have some, like, things to mention, like keyboard def is not working, for instance. And then it will be extremely nice to be able to report an issue with your equipment so that you're able to go in and then report an issue with your device, and that gets also added as a note there and then whether it was fixed or replaced or something like that.

So I had another idea, but I can't remember anymore. It was continuation on last point, but I can't remember what you said and what I wanted to say, but I think it was useful. He said about owners. He was talking about previous owners of the Yeah. About keeping logs.

Can we kinda look it up on many Yeah. Applications that are transcribing what we talk about. Okay. So for phones, it's exactly the same. So any information that applies applies to computers is is the same as for mobile phones.

Same thing for displays. The only issue with displays is that some people have multiple displays, so they don't have one. So we need to be able to assign multiple same type to one person, but that's not an issue. Dongles, we talked about. So we'll just kinda keep a log of them.

And we are most interested in dongles, how much of them do we have free for our location and the details what type of dongle it is. Some dongles have, like, USB c to HDMI to USB a to I don't know what not. Then some of them just have USB c to HDMI. Some of them have, like, TCP IP connector or whatnot, but okay. So we just need to be able to play around with those.

And, also, yeah, keyboards, mouses, all this stuff. I don't know. We have microphones. So I would say that the standard equipment is laptop, display Phone. And phone.

Tablets. Tablets. Yes. Keyboard and mouse because some a lot of especially design team uses a lot of like, they have physical mouse devices. And then dongles and everything else is in the other category.

We we also have sorry. We have printers as a because we have multiple of them in the office that should be there. But now I'm thinking about stuff like microphones for these marketing sessions, which we can track them as other other type because it's no and let's forget not forget about it, the case here. Okay. Now I remember.

We have also stuff like TVs because some of them were also bought under the zoppy zoppy part. We have a refrigerator and Cover Sorry. Cover us. Yes. I have a idea.

Let's let's start with the four basic types, and then all of these other types can be other, and then we can we can We literally put it like this. We can have, like, work equipment, which is these equipment that's used by people. Yeah. Office equipment is gonna then And we're gonna have office equipment which is gonna be printers, TVs, refrigerators, water cooler. And everything is other inside this, so we don't have to kind of Yes.

Yes. Or one printer. In in, like, terms of people, we have essentially laptops, displays, mobile phones, tablets, dongles, keyboards, mouse. That's it. We're gonna have another just in case somebody has other network equipment can have, like, a free text field for equipment because it's gonna be other type, and then you can specify whatever you want.

Okay. That's with the hardware part. And one One more thing. Yes. Do we need some kind of alert if someone is using laptop for, let's say, three years and Yes.

Doesn't complain, but Yes. We would I would love to I would love to yeah. I can I can tell you this? So a case for that would be so every year around in November, we plan for, like, a budget for next year. And France and I have to have a, like, a projection of cost.

A big part of this projection of cost is obviously the the ordering of equipment. So the way we do it right now, we just use, a rule of thumb. We're gonna take 15 used laptop a year. But it will be great to be able to log in and then have some reports. I have a table, like, I say, select by sort by date, and then it it flags in red all laptops that are older than three years.

And then in ultra red, all laptops are older than four years, and then you're able to see. I remember the the thing that I wanted to ask. Okay. What if somebody gets fired? How does that influence the history of the So equipment.

What would happen remove them from the system? I can tell you how the flow looks in my mind. That person hands over the device during their off boarding. I scan the QR code from the device. That QR code triggers a model view in which I'm able to see what what are you gonna do with this equipment.

I can assign it to somebody else. I can unassign it, and I can literally say unassign and hit confirm, and I can make the note whether it was in good condition or not. That doesn't part for me is clear. But It just becomes becomes available. So does that person get removed from the system?

If you fire me, do I get removed from the system? Yes. Yes. If I get removed from the system, then This history log changes. You know, we don't wanna be as a No.

You're not just gonna be inactive user. You're gonna be inactive user. That's fine. You're gonna be You're just asking about everything. You're gonna want to keep The history.

For example, the name of the person who who got fired and removed from the system, keep it as a note next to available and we can I was thinking more about if you need something A history of who's I don't know? If you need to ask someone who are new who was using this device about something, I don't know, anything, who's the person to ask? Yes. That's But the people the the person will stay inside. If the person is in the company, you can ask him if he's not there's no person.

But then what's how do you know there's no person to ask because the person is not in the company? Camel, I got a new laptop. It's in this in the system, it says this Mac will belong to Philip. Okay. First first owner.

In a year, I get a new laptop. Eric gets my laptop. In the system, there are so he's the owner, and the history log shows me as the previous owner. I get fired. I get removed from the system.

You said the the person who gets fired gets removed from the system. I don't know. I have When I say removed, whether it's whether it becomes a user that's inactive or suspended in the system, doesn't matter. You're just not able in technical term. That's what I'm asking.

Okay. In technical term, it just becomes an object that's inactive. And then we have a logbook that you used to own that laptop, but when you click on it, you're not able to log in with your email. You're not able to do anything, but you exist in the system as a artifact of the past. Yes.

Those are the same thing. They're like two different things. Apologize for my wording. Yes. Yes.

You're right. You're right. Okay. Anything else about equipment? When someone is requesting, they request anything basically, or we need to have something predefined, like budgets, like type of equipment I think we should kinda leave it to the team lead to see if it needs be request all the equipment types that we have in the system.

They can request it. Like mean, it's it's Request for a lot of requests for this request for that. And then the car. The important thing for request is that they should leave somewhere so that the manager and team lead can see all the re requests, and then they're able to act upon them whether to reject them or accept them. If they accept them, it just has to have, like, another, let's say, artifact, which is, like, future orders or something that Anita can take a look in and then flag as ordered.

And then when the device comes in, just associate device with the order. I can tell you straight, the most use most frequent action is gonna be rejecting requests. One more thing also came to my mind. What about books, for example? Also We shouldn't compiled We we don't need to keep them as a part of this.

I have a specific question. But it's it can be also requested. Yeah. And it's a physical object. But let's put it we're gonna deal with that in in phase two because we don't have to keep it in Can can I just ask what kind of requests are usually discarded?

What do you usually what do people usually request that you don't like? Well, I can tell you, like, stuff like all the testing devices, all the dongles are basically approved. No questions asked. Sometimes you have, like, somebody on the mobile team that has a device from the company, and then they're looking for some, I don't know, flagship model, but they just need it for work. So you're not interested buying a flagship model for, you know, building applications on your device.

That's, like, usually a part of, like, discussion with management. Sometimes people look like an overpowered MacBook, and then depending on what they're dealing with, if they're working on, I don't know, three d stuff or something that's a bit more or Eric used to have, I think, something on PinkPad or some requirement for No. I didn't. It got rejected, but you had a requirement for some fancy laptop, if I remember. Lenovo or something.

It doesn't matter. But sometimes, for instance, I know we have a couple of peep back end guys that are requesting a Windows laptop, and then depending on now it's like how to put it? How to phrase it? It's under the discretion of management to decide whether to fulfill that wish. And then when you're especially when you see a wish that's nice to have, then you're kinda, like, challenging whether you need it.

But if it's something that's literally, like I don't know. Whenever somebody requested a mouse or external keyboard, we bought them straight away, especially especially if it's necessary for real life. I get the idea. I was just actually thinking about actual examples. 90% of it is, like, this small inventory like because I don't know.

I never Dong dongle or a mouse. That's, like, the most typical I have a stupid question. What about what about pieces of equipment that are not considered standard in as a part of office equipment? For example, you have a table that's not a regular table. Right?

It will go like this. Not that that. Okay. So why We don't have to handle that. Other.

You can handle it through other. No. We we we won't handle that. It's probably gonna be under, like, work equipment, but actually, that's a good question, Filip. But why not yet?

That that will make sure Because it's generally more seamless out there for now because we don't have a billion different things. Now that Filip mentioned this, one of the requirements for this ZOPI, we literally have to take, like, physical equipment, less nonelectronical equipment as a part of our inventory. So for instance, these closets, the stand that we have in the Drawing board. The drawing board, all these things have to be labeled. So under office equipment, we should have digital equipment.

Not digital, but what's the name? We should have hardware, and then we should have, like, actual office furniture and and that stuff that needs to be classified. All the whiteboards, all the desks, all the chairs, all the whatever. I meant, is it kind of is it really needed to have a type for board, for there's no type for everything. Everything It can be like it can be work it can be office furniture as a category.

So we can bundle in all this stuff like chairs as, like, office furniture. The reason why is because is that we don't have issues like this that we have with equipment because it doesn't change hands a lot. The issue is for Anita because then at the end of the year, she literally has to go through the old invoices, and then it's not it's difficult to search in Google Drive. So for her to have, like, a list of all, you know, desks and, like, equipment and network office equipment in the company would be, like, really nice. But so, basically, you can make a request so user can request basically anything?

No. User can just request electronic devices. None nothing else. Why why why why Why limit the team? Electricity electric cables.

Because these those situations happen so seldom that there's no point in having them in the tool. But is it And then someone will come to you and ask him. The the same thing is already in the tool. So desk, if we bought it, it will need to end up in the tool. And So why would request it to to Since I never changed his laptop or never requested a new laptop, that's also a really rare thing to do for him.

No. So it's That means that we take care of Sinisha. Sinisha comes in, asks for new laptop, gets a new laptop. But why not do it? I can ask for a new table since he's back.

I want a new chair. Yeah. Should I ask him for the tool? And I'll you You would will buy die. Me a You are are breaking you are the process.

The chair will anyway end up in the tool. Yes. As a chair, so why not order it through the tool? Okay. Let us tell you this way.

If we add if we decide to have work, like, office chairs like this furniture in the tool, then yes. If not, then we don't have to add there. Okay. But you said But I'll check with Patel during break if we need to keep track of this. I mean, why not?

Because why not use one tool for this thing? Because they're kind of similar, same ish. One more small question. And in three years, are going to have 300 people. So Yeah.

It will be hard. Do do we need the a flag or something that signals if the good piece of good is actually in the office or somebody has it that works or You guys continue. I'm gonna go and check when are we ordering pizzas and but just for now. You know, this could be a part of that transcription. I was discussing, but I I want to test it because how much if he's gonna be able to filter out the pizza is definitely out of the month.

And I'll check this stuff with Matteo a lot. But question about ordering stuff or requesting stuff that's not standard. Right? So if you want like a chair, do you say, yeah, I want better chair or do you say I want this specific chair? I guess.

Yeah. But in that case You're saying you also need to to know where we can order the stuff from. Right? But paste the link, write the reason. Yes.

That's it. Let's let's leave it as open form because it has to go it it has to go to the team lead or whoever, and then it has to be approved by by a actual person. So we can leave it as an open form, like, why they needed what they needed a better laptop. I don't know what it should be. Is it 10 m four or fuck it, whatever.

It might just it's old and slow. Some people are really fussy, you they own shares that go, you know Yeah. Then let them write it, and someone will review it and say, yeah, you don't need everything. As Mira said, you don't need the flagship mobile phone. You'll need a better mobile phone.

So let's review it and to But they I It doesn't someone else's equipment. Yeah. Maybe if they need to make this transfer we need to show that equipment is still live, so we need to know that if a person is working remotely from Barcelona, and we cannot show it to the Yes. Or if you're transferring this equipment to another person, but if you know somebody who works remote, you won't I don't know. You're But he's somebody that's Or no.

But should should the trans so transferring equipment to someone else, should that even go from individual to individual, or should it go It should go all the way up Yes. Okay. You need a better laptop than what you currently have. Eric has a better one. It will be good enough for you.

We'll get him a new one. I'll transfer Eric's laptop to you. Eric, Eric signs off is one one other obvious status for for for for equipment that that they missed, and that is equipment that is lost lost or broken. I think we had few instances where the laptop was stolen at the airport or left in in a cafe and shit like that. Yeah.

Yeah. There should be some reason why something So Yeah. Malfunction In Yeah. But Basically reason why. Basically, say I stated that that says dead.

So it's not it's no longer then maybe a reason why it's connected. But but you already mentioned that you have, like, a report button that you can report malfunctioning, so whatever else. So But the device can be broken, then you can sign it off and just It's also out of scope. It's Okay. When you are signing it off, it's broken.

But you don't need to sign it off yet. Yeah. So you're okay. Fix it. So let's let's wrap up.

How do you how do you wanna do the, how do you call it, task assignment or task management? We can we can go with so we have three groups of users. Each one of them have their own user journey, I guess. So as a as a regular user, what I need to be able to do is I need to be able to enter a new device. Can I get one?

I should No. Neither does that. No. Neither does that. Okay.

So you will I guess you need to see what's assigned to you. Yeah. Okay. Request a new thing or maybe say my old thing is broken or Okay. Should So be So basic okay.

So as a basic user, you should you should be able to see your inventory and add a kind of a comment or a report regarding your inventory, and you should be able to ask for an for a new piece of inventory. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So as Just to stop you there, should we wait for Mira to come back to maybe include this software part into into workflows?

Or We can. I I think I think we can. Continue on that one. For Okay. Yeah.

For for hardware part and the software part, I think it will be bit different. It should probably be simpler than the hardware part, but much simpler. I don't know. It's going to be a bit different, but it it doesn't matter. Let's leave it for Because for software, how does it work for software if I pay with my own card?

Right? That is why I said some things will be easier, some are so let's leave it for for me or Okay. So talking you continue with the hardware for the team lead. They should be able to see all the requests made by the personnel assigned to them. And then the first line of defense, right, they figure out, and then Mira is the last line of defense.

That's how I see it. So they approve stuff, then Mira approves stuff. Yeah. Yeah. So do you request?

You go to you go to team lead team lead. Equipment as a as a team lead. Yeah. Because you're also a basic user, and then you should be You will be able to see all the team equipment. Yes.

Yes. I will see why not. And you should be able to to reject requests made by team members or approve them, in which case they get sent to Mero. So the ones you reject never reach Mero. You can probably find them in the old old request or something, but they never reach him as a as a action light.

Does that make sense? Reject any word and on to why was it rejected or something like that. Or maybe we should have this ping pong system, like, update your request. Okay. Like, it doesn't have to go through the system, but let's make the the request kind of not fixed, but you can always amend it and change it until someone approves it or discards it.

Like Okay. All of these I mean, all all these requests that you make or you you reject or approve or whatever, they actually change the entry in the database for this particular item. So, basically, all all when you request something new, you you you are you are requesting a a change to the database where new item will be added. When you report is broken, you are we're also changing the item. So But when you order when you want a new item Based on this order, you can you can create a new item.

And then then But why if it's if you won't get it, why create Okay. Then it it will be it rejected. Yeah. I would leave it for the whoever purchases, actually. Yeah.

Okay. I'll I'll make I'm I'm thinking how how to connect the orders in a in a database. So the way it seems to me right now is that every every change in the inventory is made through a action, we can call it action, which can be request new or reports or reports stolen or request transfer or test transferred. And these actions, as I I think, the the result will update or not update the inventory. No.

So you cannot update inventory. I think we're going out of scope. You're not. Yeah. We have to do are taking the we are discussing technical details.

As Let's go back to the user journeys then. So we covered we covered the users. We covered team leads. Let's not cover the admin. It's basically I just wanted to say that the team leads should also be able to create an invite.

Yeah. A new user. So I mean, in theory, should just be able to see everything and do whatever. But let's face it, the majority of the work actual work in the system is gonna be through a team lead or through a regular user. In the beginning, you said that you will set up the teams and Yes.

Yes. Yes. But after it's set up, everything else is gonna be Okay. Okay. Go ahead.

One, you were mentioning invoices. We were mentioning that we're going to have invoices and that we need some stuff for accounting. Do we need a role for accounting? That should be No. That's No.

I would be an admin. So I need to have access to it. But one thing now that we should talk about before we get to software part of all of this is once a year, we should be able to do like an inventory Checkup. Checkup, which is basically which are literally just going through the list to see if everything that exists in the system actually exists in the world that somebody didn't stole something because today, we wouldn't know. Today, we will see, like, a serial number, and then we will simply tell people it's like, hey.

Who has this? So in theory, people are able to steal whatever they want for now. Okay. So we should do, like, an inventory checkup in which, basically, user has to receive, like, some form of prompt or a pop up or something listing, hey, Bruno. We're doing an annual checkup.

This equipment is listed under you. Press confirm if it's everything or add something new or change, and then you literally go every employee does it. And then at the end, you you flagged under your, like, whole inventory overview of the list of items that nobody report that they have them or there was a mismatch or something. Do you need to answer you were doing that this year. Yes.

You were asking if it's okay everything okay. Do we need also to ask in that annual No. Because they will be able to do it through throughout the system at any time. But we need literally, like, an inventory checkup saying, hey, Luca. Do you have this, this, this, and this?

He says, yes. And then it gets flagged. And that's something that admin can trigger basically at any time. So it's a notification in the system pop up. Hey, Luca.

You need to submit this form. He clicks on it. Probably mail rather. Yeah. System.

I don't know. But it can be both. Yeah. It can be both. You receive an email to go check into the system.

It doesn't have to be anything specific. But, yeah, you approve or mark any changes. We've been talking for fifty five minutes here. Should we spend five minutes around software? Yeah.

Around the the other one. Yeah. The one Or you I don't think it's going to be five minutes. So software is gonna be easy. I can tell you I can tell you why.

So let's put it this way. So I can give you an example of a software license. So it's usually I don't know. We have a software license that belongs to a certain individual or belongs to a team. Or a company.

Or a company. So in the case of, let's say, Nikola, Nikola has like a subscription for Cloth. Cloth mobbing framework, it doesn't Yes. No. No.

No. Wait. Wait. But you have like, let's say, Notion that's only used by you. I mean, it's not used by you.

It's used by other people, but you are the account holder for Notion. Right? Then we have some stuff probably cloud code for your person and then cloud code for the entire Team. Design team. Then we have mobin that's accessed by entire design team.

So you have a good combination of, like, your own individual licenses and licenses that are shared by the team. Filipe Pitak has DevOps there is DevOps courses that was paid for. Him has always owner of a QA courses that's shared by the team. So usually license is either, again, like the equipment, either owned by an individual or it's owned by a team. Or the company.

Or the company. But, yeah, it doesn't make a difference between a team and the company because anybody in the company can have access to it, but it doesn't matter. What makes software different is that it's always tied to a certain email. So there's always an email whether an email is designed at Profico or not that it's at Profico, doesn't matter. It's always an email behind it.

And then there are like two methods of or three methods of payment. So if it's done by a company card, you usually have, like, a company invoice attached to it. When I say company invoice, it literally means that there is a name of the company in our VAT ID listed on the bill. So it can literally be a personal invoice that has Innovate or Profits instead of name and has our VAT ID instead of a phone number as long as because that's like Croatian law. And then it's okay.

Then it's not an issue. The only issue that we then have is to retrieve all the invoices that were purchased by a company card. So the issue that I have today is I need to maintain a list of all the subscriptions, and then I need to nag Nicola to export me everything for Notion. I need to nag France to export everything for change apt and so on. So I need to be able to tell which kind of licenses do I have for which type of person.

And we don't have to do an integration to fetch them through the API of Stripe or anything. I just need to know which license, which email, who's the person that I should reach out for the invoice, and what's the price of the license, whether it's a monthly subscription or yearly subscription. Subscription. That's sorry. That's one case.

And that's case that's case is important because as long as it's paid by a company card and as long as we order like an air air one or a business invoice, we need to have a log of them. Second one is, for instance, in Eric's case. So in Eric's case, we bought him he bought himself a Cloth subscription, and it's on his own account and on his own card, but we reimburse him with, like, a fixed monthly bonus to cover the cost of that subscription. So, essentially, that doesn't mean nothing because we're not legally buying. Eric bought him for himself, so it's off the books.

But it's important to know that you should, you know, reimburse Eric and that Eric has that subscription under his, let's say, position. Because when somebody else joins, if we need it, then we're gonna be okay. Eric has this issue. So how Should we kind of discourage Yes. That kind of arrangement, let's call it, and do everything kind of by the book and let the company Both of them are by the book.

The only issue is meant literally by the book because have a system for Okay. Literal book. No. I would fact, I would rather prefer this second option because the second option doesn't require you to maintain any history of logs or events of all the invoices. So it's perfectly clear.

You know, Eric bought it, Eric gets reimbursed, and then it's like one by one. The issue why it cannot be kept on the books is because a lot of these tools, they actually have like a business plan, and the business plan is like 20 or 30% more expensive than like a personal plan that you can pay with a company card. Okay. And it's literally like sometimes it's 50% more expensive. So it depends on the type of A personal plan with the company card, should that be the preferred way of doing it?

But some of them are then some of them the reason why I have to do it here is because they don't allow you to enter the company Ah. Company name. Or, for instance, JGPT has the ability to send it to
