# Profico Internal Inventory Management System

Version: v1.0 (September 22, 2025)

### TL;DR

Profico's growing team (30→300 employees) struggles with fragmented equipment tracking via Google Sheets, missing invoices, and unclear ownership leading to compliance headaches and budget planning inefficiency. The Internal Inventory Management System unifies hardware tracking and software license management with role-based workflows, QR code integration, and Croatian compliance reporting—eliminating manual processes while enabling accurate budget planning and audit readiness within 12 months.

## Goals

### Business Goals

* **Eliminate manual tracking inefficiency** - Replace Google Sheets/Forms processes with automated workflows, reducing equipment management overhead by 80% within 6 months.

* **Enable data-driven budget planning** - Replace "rule of thumb" 15 laptops/year approach with equipment age analysis and replacement forecasting, improving budget accuracy by 60%.

* **Ensure Croatian compliance readiness** - Automate ZOPI fund reporting, €150 asset tracking, and tax inspection documentation with <24 hour export capability.

* **Support company scaling** - Build system architecture that handles 10x user growth (30→300 employees) without performance degradation or workflow breakdown.

### User Goals

* **Streamline equipment requests** - Enable one-click equipment requests with transparent approval status, reducing request-to-fulfillment time from weeks to 3 business days.

* **Eliminate ownership confusion** - Provide real-time visibility of assigned equipment, transfer history, and responsibility tracking for all users.

* **Simplify compliance workflows** - Automate annual inventory checkups, invoice collection, and audit documentation without manual coordination.

* **Enable mobile efficiency** - QR code scanning for instant equipment identification, check-in/check-out, and condition reporting.

### Non-Goals

* **Financial system integration** - No direct accounting software connection or payment processing (export-based compliance instead).

* **Advanced inventory optimization** - No automated reorder points, AI recommendations, or predictive analytics in v1.

* **External vendor management** - No vendor catalogs, purchasing workflows, or supplier integration.

## Stakeholder Analysis & Conflict Resolution

### Stakeholder Requirement Matrix

#### Confirmed Consensus Requirements
**Business Requirements:**
- **Equipment Request Automation**: Supported by Mira (admin) and all team leads to eliminate manual coordination overhead
- **Budget Planning Data**: Validated by annual planning needs and demonstrated "rule of thumb" inadequacy for 300-person scale
- **Croatian Compliance**: Required for tax inspection readiness, ZOPI fund reporting, and VAT documentation accuracy
- **Software License Consolidation**: Consensus on scattered subscription tracking and invoice collection inefficiency

**Operational Requirements:**
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Security requirement with three clear user levels (employee, team lead, admin)
- **Equipment Transfer Workflow**: Confirmed need for device reassignment during team changes and departures
- **QR Code Integration**: Efficiency requirement for mobile equipment identification and rapid processing

#### Stakeholder Conflicts & Resolutions

**🔄 Conflict 1: Equipment Tracking Scope (Hardware vs Office Furniture)**
- **Admin Position (Mira)**: Focus on electronic equipment only for MVP to control complexity and timeline
- **Compliance Position (Matteo)**: Include office furniture tracking for ZOPI fund compliance and accounting requirements
- **✅ Resolution**: Two-tier implementation - "Work Equipment" (laptops, phones, displays) in Phase 1, "Office Equipment" (furniture, printers) in Phase 2
- **📋 Rationale**: Electronic equipment has higher turnover and immediate workflow impact; furniture needed for compliance but lower operational priority
- **👑 Decision Owner**: Admin (Mira) with compliance team quarterly review

**🔄 Conflict 2: User Request Limitations (Electronics Only vs Universal)**
- **Process Position**: Limit requests to electronic equipment to prevent scope creep and inappropriate requests
- **User Experience Position**: Allow universal equipment requests for workflow consistency and comprehensive resource management
- **✅ Resolution**: Open request system with equipment categorization - users can request any equipment type, approval workflow handles appropriateness
- **📈 Success Criteria**: <5% rejected requests due to inappropriate equipment type, >90% user satisfaction with request process

**🔄 Conflict 3: Small Item Tracking (Individual vs Bulk Management)**
- **Detailed Tracking Position**: Individual tracking for all equipment to maintain complete asset visibility
- **Practical Management Position**: Bulk quantity tracking for small items (dongles, cables) to reduce administrative overhead
- **✅ Resolution**: Hybrid approach based on Croatian accounting law - items >€150 individually tracked with serial numbers, items <€150 managed as bulk inventory
- **📋 Rationale**: Legal requirement for €150+ individual tracking, operational efficiency for smaller items without compliance risk
- **👑 Decision Owner**: Admin with accounting team validation

### Open Decisions & Research Pipeline

#### 🚧 Architecture Decisions (Blocking Implementation)
**Decision**: QR Code Integration Strategy
**Options**: Custom QR generation with printed stickers vs existing manufacturer barcode scanning vs hybrid approach
**Research Needed**: Cost-benefit analysis of printer/sticker infrastructure vs scanning accuracy of existing equipment barcodes
**📅 Decision Timeline**: Week 2 of Phase 1 to avoid implementation delays
**👤 Decision Owner**: Admin (Mira) with operations team input on practical workflow requirements
**⚠️ Impact if Delayed**: Manual equipment identification processes reduce efficiency gains by 40%, mobile workflow degradation

#### 🔍 Product Decisions (Can proceed with assumptions)
**Decision**: OCR Invoice Processing Implementation
**Current Assumption**: Manual invoice upload and data entry for MVP, OCR enhancement in Phase 2
**Validation Needed**: Croatian invoice format standardization and OCR accuracy testing with real company invoices
**📅 Decision Timeline**: Phase 2 planning (Month 5) based on Phase 1 manual process pain points
**🔄 Fallback Plan**: Continue structured manual data entry with improved upload forms and validation

## Narrative

**Today**, Profico's equipment management resembles a detective story. When accounting needs to verify a laptop's location for tax inspection, Mira searches through scattered Google Sheets, emails multiple team members asking "Do you have the MacBook with serial ABC123?", and waits days for responses—sometimes discovering equipment is missing or ownership unclear. New employees wait weeks for equipment while approvals bounce between email threads, and budget planning relies on rough estimates because nobody knows which laptops are three years old and due for replacement.

**Tomorrow**, the same tax inspection scenario unfolds differently. The inspector asks about laptop ABC123, and Mira opens the Inventory Management System, instantly seeing it's assigned to Nikola, purchased via ZOPI fund in 2022, currently in good condition based on his last check-in. She exports a complete audit trail in 30 seconds. When a new designer starts Monday, she submitted her equipment request Friday through the app, her team lead approved it within hours, and Mira already has the laptop configured and labeled with a QR code for immediate assignment. The system's budget planning dashboard shows exactly which equipment needs replacement next quarter, enabling accurate financial forecasting instead of guesswork.

**Strategically**, this transformation positions Profico for confident scaling. As the company grows from 30 to 300 employees, equipment management complexity multiplies exponentially—but the system's role-based structure, automated workflows, and mobile-first design ensure operational efficiency remains constant. The comprehensive audit trail satisfies increasingly complex compliance requirements, while real-time analytics enable proactive decision-making that prevents equipment bottlenecks from constraining business growth. Most importantly, teams spend time building products instead of hunting for hardware information, directly supporting Profico's mission to deliver exceptional client value.
