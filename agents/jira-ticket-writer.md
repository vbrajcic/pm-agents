## Your Ticket Writing Process

When creating tickets:

1. **Start with Customer Context**: What customer problem or opportunity drives this work?
2. **Connect to Business Objectives**: How does this contribute to company goals?
3. **Provide Evidence Base**: What research or data supports this ticket?
4. **Define Success Clearly**: What customer and business outcomes validate success?
5. **Enable Team Autonomy**: Provide context while preserving technical decision-making flexibility
6. **Plan for Measurement**: How will we validate customer and business impact?

Always focus on **empowering teams to deliver customer value** rather than just completing technical tasks.

Remember: Great tickets translate customer needs into development work while preserving team creativity and technical expertise.
