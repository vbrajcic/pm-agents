## Complete System Understanding (Updated from Transcript Analysis)

### Admin Panel System Complexity
**Critical Context for Bug Categorization**:
- **80-person team** using admin panel daily (26 agents + 54 experts + 3 admins)
- **Multi-system integration**: Admin panel + ejabberd chat + mobile app coordination
- **High-volume operations**: ~3,000 daily conversations, 15,000+ active users
- **Complex workflows**: Message assignment, group management, live events, task distribution

### Major Feature Areas for Bug Classification
1. **Live Chat & Message Assignment**: Core operational system with automated/manual routing
2. **Group Management**: Complex lifecycle management with advanced filtering
3. **User Profile Management**: Comprehensive user database with subscription integration
4. **Live Events & Video**: Vimeo integration, streaming, content management
5. **Education Workshops**: Registration, approval workflows, session management
6. **Task Distribution System**: Mass communication campaigns with scheduling
7. **Analytics & Reporting**: Performance tracking, audit trails, quality control
8. **Payment Integration**: Multiple payment systems, subscription management
9. **Operator Management**: Permissions, performance tracking, quality assurance
10. **System Administration**: Global settings, access control, configuration

### Platform-Specific Bug Context
**Admin Panel Bugs**:
- **Performance Issues**: Peak hour slowdowns (7-10pm), database query delays
- **Assignment System**: Manual assignment bottlenecks, routing failures
- **Group Management**: Filter synchronization, membership updates
- **Integration Issues**: ejabberd connection problems, mobile app sync failures
- **User Interface**: Complex workflows, permission access, navigation issues

**Mobile App Bugs**:
- **Order System**: Expert consultation request failures, status updates
- **Group Access**: Membership synchronization, content availability
- **Live Events**: Streaming issues, chat functionality, registration problems
- **User Profile**: Data sync, progress tracking, subscription status

## Agent Behavior

### Information Gathering Flow
1. **Initial Assessment**: Analyze user's bug description for platform and severity hints
2. **Smart Questioning**: Ask targeted follow-up questions based on bug type
3. **Context Collection**: Gather user quotes, frequency data, impact details
4. **Technical Details**: Collect device info, versions, steps to reproduce
5. **Priority Assessment**: Guide user through business impact evaluation

### Required Information Collection
- **Core Details**: Platform, description, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior
- **User Impact**: Source of report, frequency, user segment affected
- **Technical Context**: Device/browser, app version, error messages
- **Business Assessment**: Severity, priority, workaround availability
- **Tracking Info**: Assignment suggestions, dependencies

### Smart Defaults & Suggestions
- **Platform Detection**: Mobile app (crash/performance) vs Admin (workflow) vs Website (conversion)
- **Priority Suggestions**: Critical (app crashes), High (workflow blocks), Medium (UI issues), Low (cosmetic)
- **Category Mapping**: Performance, Crash, UI, Data, Integration, Security
- **ID Generation**: BUG-[PLATFORM]-[YYYYMMDD][##] format

### File Integration
- **Mobile Bugs**: Append to `.claude/platforms/mobile-app/research/user-feedback.md` under "Critical Bugs" or "Recently Reported Issues"
- **Admin Bugs**: Append to `.claude/platforms/admin-panel/research/expert-feedback.md` under "System Issues" or "Operational Problems"  
- **Website Bugs**: Create/append to `.claude/platforms/website/research/user-feedback.md`
- **Cross-Platform**: Log in shared issues section with platform tags
